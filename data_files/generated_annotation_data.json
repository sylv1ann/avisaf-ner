[["To be clear I did not have a lot going on and my complexity was not high. That is why this was a non-event. However; ORD was super busy on two runways for a little bit and I am sure the Tower was very busy landing 28C departing 28R and 22L. Ground could have also been busy so that is why I put the information in there on complexity and amount of volume. Here is what happened; we were on outboards at ORD. There were a lot of aircraft going over the airport to balance the runways. I had a strip print and an aircraft depart and tag up. It was Aircraft Z. I was waiting for this aircraft to call on. I was waiting and waiting and making a plan. Then the aircraft started climbing out of 5;000 feet; so I reached out and tried to turn the aircraft. He didn't turn or answer. I didn't know what happened or was happening. Then I did it again. I was just about to call back to the Tower and the position next to me was giving a briefing and they turned their aircraft to EARND.Aircraft X. Now they departed off of two different runways but I said to the guy next to me; 'Hey; see if you have Aircraft Z by chance.' He did. So somehow Aircraft Z going westbound departing off of Runway 28R was on the same frequency as Aircraft X departing off of Runway 22L. When the instruction for Aircraft X was given; Aircraft Z and Aircraft X took it. The Controller said he didn't hear any indication that there was a step on each other or anything. During this time Aircraft Y also had departed and went to the incorrect frequency and that Controller had to send him to the correct frequency. So there were 3 similar sounding aircraft on 1 frequency when only two were supposed to be there and they were all climbing when only two were supposed to be. We have tried to explain how bad incorrect frequency transfers could be and have kept records for months but it seems there is no sense of urgency at how bad this could be. The two aircraft came within approximately 4 miles from each other with one climbing blindly. That was very lucky.My recommendations would be to track these incidents when similar sounding aircraft are on the same frequency so that it can be brought to the airline dispatchers' attention and show the replay on what could happen and why they should be aware of the issue. However; when I have brought these things recently to our supervisors in the room; they have been advised that they should not keep track of things like this by [the] upper management Operations managers and higher. They tell us we should report it when they could report it just like I can. This was luck this time that nothing happened. So I guess we will just open that Swiss cheese holes with negligence and laziness and I will be in the seat one day when two planes come together and I may not be lucky like this time to be able to listen to the person next to me give the briefing. Or we can go back to due diligence; attentiveness; and caring and report things like this and care about the operation. Put effort on everyone's end to know when similar call signs are on frequencies or multiple frequencies. Demand that Dispatch works hard to not use call signs like this. Or not; who cares any more right.", {"entities": [[186, 191, "CREW"], [880, 885, "CREW"], [117, 120, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [403, 406, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [143, 150, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [475, 482, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1027, 1034, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [428, 436, "AIRPLANE"], [511, 519, "AIRPLANE"], [581, 589, "AIRPLANE"], [656, 664, "AIRPLANE"], [740, 748, "AIRPLANE"], [958, 966, "AIRPLANE"], [1615, 1623, "AIRPLANE"], [1922, 1930, "AIRPLANE"], [2103, 2111, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
["While descending into PIB out of 14;000 ft. MSL; our aircraft was repeatedly illuminated by a green laser pointer approximately 100 times over about 5 minutes. The first illumination was from a distance of around 20-30 miles. The aircraft had a failed flight director and autopilot at the time and extra attention was required by both pilots for flight path management. Both pilots were directly hit by the laser on several occasions causing minor vision spotting. We notified approach of the approximate source location as we went over it. The laser continued hitting the aircraft as we flew by illuminating the entire flight deck. We were able to land at PIB without incident. I still have spots in my eyes approximately 1.5 hours after exposure. This was by far the worst encounter I have had with a laser while flying an aircraft.It seems to me that pointing a laser at an aircraft should be made illegal.

["I was boarding the aircraft when a my destination airport changed a NOTAM at my destination airport closing the runway until a further time that day; at the time I was in the aircraft boarding my passengers as I had received an IFR clearance to my destination 10 minutes before. While I was departing the area VFR on an IFR clearance I encountered moderate turbulence below 9000 ft. I reported the weather conditions to both ARTCC and [Operations Control]. At 9000 ft. I entered Icing conditions and requested a higher altitude to get out of the ice. I was assigned 11000 ft. and once established in cruise approximately 50NM from billings I was advised by ARTCC that ZZZ my destination airport had just reported both runway closures and to advise of intentions. I contacted [Operations Control] of the situation and suggested a possible diversion to ZZZ1 instead so as to shuttle the passengers to ZZZ and return back REPO. They liked the plan and said they would contact ZZZ1 to gain conditions and see if they could organize passenger transport. I advised my passengers of the situation. I then was contacted by [Operations Control] that the situation was also bad in ZZZ1 and they too intended to close the runway. I then advised ATC a return to ZZZ2. Shortly after this radio communication I encountered Freezing Rain I advised ATC of the weather conditions and [Operations Control] I also requested a decent to get out of icing conditions. Shortly after this I noticed the annunciation panel was black during windshield operation and noticed the ice was not coming off the windshield. I complied with the QRH and [Requested Priority Handling] with ARTCC due to windshield anti-ice failure. I notified [Operations Control] and got into contact with the ZZZ2 station Manager and advised him of the weather conditions in the area at the diversion airport and of the priority situation. After descending several thousand feet the ice did not clear. I requested ATC give me a lower altitude to try and reach above freezing altitude. At approximately 6000 ft. the windshield ice broke off and I continued with a Visual Approach to Runway XX. After I landed and taxied in I spoke with the passengers: [airport rescue and firefighting]; [Operations Control]; Dispatch; [Maintenance Control]; Station Manager and Station Supervisor about the situation. I made a maintenance log book entry and complied with company policy and procedure to secure the aircraft at the hanger.Windshield De-ice/Anti-Ice Circuit Breaker tripped in icing conditions.

["I had a ferry flight that went out of service when a maintenance discrepancy was submitted.

I assumed he would know to wait for the in service message; but with a ferry flight; many pilots often get confused on the policies/procedures.There should be more clear guidance to pilots about non-routine flights; like test flights and ferry flights; that they need to be showing in service before departing; no matter what Line Maintenance or Maintenance Control tells them.

["Aircraft X was approximately 5 Miles NW of the field when Approach Control approval-requested a right downwind entry for Runway 25; capped 2;000 and above for other VFR arrival aircraft for Runway 15L. I approved the request; as soon as traffic permitted I allowed Aircraft X his VFR descent at pilot discretion when he was approximately 2 Miles NNE of the field. Aircraft Y was 5 Miles south of the field; eastbound; on the visual approach for Runway 25. I immediately recognized the conflict. I instructed Aircraft X to turn Base; at this time he was approximately 2.5 Miles NE of the field. I informed Aircraft Y of the glider traffic and instructed him to execute a 5 Mile left base; at this time Aircraft Y was approximately 5 SE of the field. Aircraft Y asked if he needed to extend; I said affirmative; enter a 5 Mile left base. Aircraft Y immediately turned inbound for a 3 Mile left base. Aircraft X was established on a 2 Mile final and at 80 kts. I instructed Aircraft X to go around; he responded unable due to his engine being shut down. I then told Aircraft Y to go around; climb and maintain 3;000; fly heading 255. Aircraft Y read back his instructions and began to climb. I then coordinated with Approach Control; Aircraft Y was on the Standard Missed and coming back to him for re-sequence; Approach Control requested a 200 heading. I issued the 200 heading to Aircraft Y and told him to contact departure. I thought Aircraft Y had started turning and I switched him; but he was not turning. I realized he was heading into a much higher MVA. I told Aircraft Y he needed to start his turn to 200; that he was entering an MVA of 5700 feet but he had already switched frequencies. Adequate initial spacing and sequence provided by approach controller. Compliance from the Aircraft Y pilot to enter a 5 Mile left base. Compliance from Aircraft Y pilot to take assigned headings. Ensuring the pilot is physically turning to assigned heading to avoid conflict prior to frequency change.\nWe took LC (Local Control) for training; I was the trainer. It was in the middle of our training session that approach approved a right down wind arrival for RWY 25. Glider Aircraft X was told to turn a 3mile right base for RWY 25. At that time Aircraft Y was switched to us about 6 miles south of the airport on a visual approach. The trainee told Aircraft Y about glider traffic and instructed Aircraft Y to turn 5 mile left base. The trainee expected Aircraft Y to enter a 5 mile final; however; Aircraft Y turned a 5 mile left base for a 2 mile final and at that time Aircraft X was on a 2 mile going 70 kts. We realized it was not going to work with Aircraft Y going 170 kts so we tried to send Aircraft X around. Aircraft x told us they couldn't go around because their engine was off; so we made the decision to send Aircraft Y around. Initially; Aircraft Y was told to fly northerly hoping to build some space; then they were told to expect to go around. They were given a climb to 030 and a 255 heading; but they never acknowledged and continued northerly. The trainee coordinated the go around with the approach controller; which told us to give Aircraft Y a 200 heading. The trainee gave Aircraft Y that heading and switched them to approach. The aircraft continued northerly into a 5700 feet MVA for another few miles before they started their turn. After reviewing and listening to the tapes; we concluded that there was a misunderstanding between us and Aircraft Y. We gave certain instructions; but didn't get the results we expected. We should have used more control instructions such as; extend your downwind I'll call your base. We also switched Aircraft Y a bit too early; especially since he was heading in a north direction into a 5700 feet MVA.

["The First Officer noticed smoke coming from the flight counter on his yoke. We [advised ATC] and returned.\nJust prior to takeoff; both the Captain and I noticed a smell that we associated with the air conditioning system. The smell was faint prior to takeoff. After takeoff and selecting the flaps up; the smell became increasingly strong and changed to a burning plastic smell. I placed my hand on the upper half of the control wheel to initiate a turn towards a heading of 280. The flight counter (upper left) felt very hot to the touch; enough so that I couldn't touch that portion of the control wheel. I turned on my reading light and engaged the autopilot and saw smoke emanating from the flight counter. I informed the Captain and we immediately dawned masks and established Crew comm. We informed Departure of our [situation] and intention to return. Control was transferred to the Captain and I began running the smoke and fumes checklist.

["It all started at Gate XX; when we noticed a 'Service door unlocked' indication on the door's page. We recycled closing the service door a couple times without success after which we made the entry in the logbook and called maintenance. Two maintenance personnel arrived within 5 minutes and started working on it; they ended up deferring the service door and associated ground valve. Maintenance struggled with their computer system and it wasn't until XB19Z that they returned with the logbook after leaving around XA40Z without leaving explanations. Dropped the brake at XB23Z; We requested XXR to expedite the departure with an off of XB41Z. In the climb; around 8;500 feet; a caution message 'Cabin Alt' came to our attention. We [advised ATC of] our intentions to return to the field; we requested vectors with time to run the QRH. The aircraft was not pressurizing and the manual control procedure ineffective; we completed the unpressurized procedure to make sure it would be unpressurized upon landing. All appropriate communications with ATC; dispatch; operations; the cabin; and a brief PA were made. We landed at 79;000 pounds with a rate of 300 ft/min. Arrived at Gate XY and entered the discrepancies in the maintenance logbook. As we walked off the aircraft for an aircraft swap; maintenance confirmed that the ground valve had not been correctly closed when following MEL directives.Identification: In flight by EICAS messageCause: The ground valve was not properly closed by maintenanceSuggestions: Stress with maintenance personnel the implications of their work.\nThe flight began at Gate XX with a FWD Service Door amber message that would not go away after the door was cycled closed several times. Maintenance was contacted via radio at XA07Z. They sent a crew out and arrived 5 minutes later. Once the maintenance team verified the problem; they decided to MEL the Service Door indication system. This MEL necessitated the MEL of the ground valve. Maintenance completed their work and returned the aircraft logbook to the Captain at XB19Z. We finished our checklists and were 'out' at XB23Z. We requested takeoff from XXR in order to minimize further delays for our passengers and were granted the request with a subsequent 'off' time of XB41Z. During the initial climb while communicating with ZZZ Departure; we received a CABIN ALT amber caution message on the EICAS. We decided to level the plane off and the Captain [advised ATC] and requested 9;000 feet and vectors in order to run the QRH. The Captain gave me the radios and controls while he ran the QRH. The aircraft was not pressurizing at all and the manual pressurization checklist did not solve the problem. The captain then ran the QRH directed unpressurized procedure to ensure the aircraft would remain unpressurized upon landing. The Captain contacted the FAs; Dispatch; Operations; and I updated ATC with pertinent information about our emergency. We set up the aircraft for return to ZZZ and landing on XXR and briefed the approach. We discussed that the Captain would land the aircraft due to the fact it would be an overweight landing. We exchanged the controls prior to intercepting the final approach course. The Captain landed the aircraft and taxied the aircraft to the gate without further issue. The landing was made at 79;000 lbs and at a decent rate of 300 ft/min. After arrival at Gate XY; the appropriate entries were made in the logbook; walk-around completed; and the Captain notified maintenance. Upon leaving the aircraft; maintenance informed us that the ground valve was not fully closed as it should have been when completing the MEL before pushback.The failure to fully close the ground valve caused the aircraft to not pressurize during flight.", {"entities": [[1617, 1620, "ABBREVIATION"], [205, 212, "AVIATION_TERM"], [488, 495, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1234, 1241, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2029, 2036, "AVIATION_TERM"], [3432, 3439, "AVIATION_TERM"], [653, 658, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2286, 2291, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3266, 3270, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [418, 433, "AIRPLANE"], [371, 383, "AIRPLANE"], [1326, 1338, "AIRPLANE"], [1452, 1464, "AIRPLANE"], [1956, 1968, "AIRPLANE"], [3562, 3574, "AIRPLANE"], [3690, 3702, "AIRPLANE"], [224, 235, "CREW"], [241, 252, "CREW"], [1222, 1233, "CREW"], [1295, 1306, "CREW"], [565, 570, "AIRPLANE"], [1079, 1084, "AIRPLANE"], [833, 836, "ABBREVIATION"], [2513, 2516, "ABBREVIATION"], [2579, 2582, "ABBREVIATION"], [2717, 2720, "ABBREVIATION"], [54, 58, "AIRPLANE"], [87, 91, "AIRPLANE"], [132, 136, "AIRPLANE"], [351, 355, "AIRPLANE"], [1681, 1685, "AIRPLANE"], [1384, 1387, "ABBREVIATION"], [1879, 1882, "ABBREVIATION"], [1924, 1927, "ABBREVIATION"], [1945, 1948, "ABBREVIATION"], [3639, 3642, "ABBREVIATION"], [667, 677, "ALTITUDE"], [842, 850, "AIRPLANE"], [1264, 1272, "AIRPLANE"], [1280, 1288, "AIRPLANE"], [2020, 2028, "AIRPLANE"], [2588, 2596, "AIRPLANE"], [2768, 2776, "AIRPLANE"], [2951, 2959, "AIRPLANE"], [3068, 3076, "AIRPLANE"], [3226, 3234, "AIRPLANE"], [3250, 3258, "AIRPLANE"], [3519, 3527, "AIRPLANE"], [3714, 3722, "AIRPLANE"], [2470, 2480, "ALTITUDE"], [3650, 3658, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1115, 1121, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3215, 3221, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3441, 3452, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1098, 1100, "ABBREVIATION"], [614, 623, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1428, 1433, "ABBREVIATION"], [2385, 2390, "ABBREVIATION"], [2044, 2051, "CREW"], [2434, 2441, "CREW"], [2522, 2529, "CREW"], [2822, 2829, "CREW"], [3045, 3052, "CREW"], [3207, 3214, "CREW"], [3472, 3479, "CREW"], [744, 747, "CREW"], [1048, 1051, "CREW"], [2451, 2454, "CREW"], [2885, 2888, "CREW"], [804, 811, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2485, 2492, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1003, 1010, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2809, 2816, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2982, 2989, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3119, 3126, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3298, 3305, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [18, 22, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1177, 1181, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1602, 1606, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3382, 3386, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

["When the crew arrived at [the aircraft]; Maintenance Control had deferred the ground idle portion of the EEC's (Electronic Engine Control). Myself as the Captain looked over the DDG (Dispatch Deviation Guide); talked with the two mechanics on board and found that everything was written off properly. The Mechanic and I discussed the ramifications a little bit on the referral. The plane blocked out on time with a normal engine start and normal taxi to [the] runway. However upon takeoff clearance and bringing the thrust levers up to approximately 70% we noticed the right engine was accelerating quicker than the left engine. It wasn't exceeding any limitations but still as the Captain and because we had the deferral concerning the situation ; I felt it would be better/ conservative to just bring the thrust levers back and taxi off the runway and discuss what was actually going on with the mechanics in a safe environment on the taxiway and that is what I did. I asked the First Officer to cancel takeoff clearance and that we would like to clear the runway and discuss a possible maintenance issue. So we cleared the runway; I spoke to the mechanics about the situation and it is quite common on most of the 767 200s for the right engine to accelerate quicker than the left engine. I don't know why this is but I've noticed it on many different airplanes. So we cleared the runway.I spoke to the mechanics about the situation. I remembered talking to Maintenance Control the day before and he informed me there are no time limits for the engines to accelerate together. At this moment on the taxiway I confirm that with the two mechanics that only the two engines had to match and then accelerate uniformly after takeoff thrust button was pushed and takeoff power is set. After clearing the runway there were no checklists to be run since there are no EICAS messages or abnormal events. I just wanted to understand that everything was fairly normal. The break chart was not needed to be consulted since we never really release the brakes for takeoff. Takeoff power was never set. By definition in the FOM a rejected takeoff was never really performed since take off power was never set however I am going to treat this like a rejected takeoff just in case. The two mechanics and the First Officer and myself discussed that we would perform the takeoff again.... let the engines both stabilize at approximately 70% and then push the takeoff thrust button and if the engines accelerated absolutely perfectly symmetrically to takeoff thrust then we would continue the takeoff. This is exactly what happened on the second takeoff and this is normally what happens on most of the 767 200s. The engines do not accelerate to 70% symmetrically all the time but they do accelerate from 70%to takeoff thrust symmetrically. Maintenance Control and the mechanics confirmed there is no time limit to where these engines have to accelerate to the 70% setting. The takeoff was normal.\n[Report narrative contained no additional information.]", {"entities": [[2040, 2046, "AIRPLANE"], [230, 239, "CREW"], [898, 907, "CREW"], [1149, 1158, "CREW"], [1405, 1414, "CREW"], [1637, 1646, "CREW"], [2274, 2283, "CREW"], [2850, 2859, "CREW"], [460, 466, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [843, 849, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1059, 1065, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1126, 1132, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1383, 1389, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1800, 1806, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [516, 529, "AIRPLANE"], [807, 820, "AIRPLANE"], [123, 137, "AIRPLANE"], [422, 428, "AIRPLANE"], [575, 581, "AIRPLANE"], [621, 627, "AIRPLANE"], [1240, 1246, "AIRPLANE"], [1283, 1289, "AIRPLANE"], [1737, 1743, "AIRPLANE"], [2456, 2462, "AIRPLANE"], [9, 13, "CREW"], [981, 994, "CREW"], [2292, 2305, "CREW"], [243, 248, "AIRPLANE"], [481, 498, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1005, 1022, "AVIATION_TERM"], [382, 387, "AIRPLANE"], [105, 108, "ABBREVIATION"], [30, 38, "AIRPLANE"], [41, 60, "CREW"], [1460, 1479, "CREW"], [2822, 2841, "CREW"], [318, 319, "CREW"], [2116, 2132, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2235, 2251, "AVIATION_TERM"], [937, 944, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1601, 1608, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [154, 161, "CREW"], [682, 689, "CREW"], [446, 450, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [830, 834, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [305, 313, "CREW"], [178, 181, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],
["During descent into ZZZ on the RNAV arrival; I was the PF (Pilot Flying) and the CA (Captain) was the PM (Pilot Monitoring). ATC told us to expect Runway XXL and cleared us to point ZZZZZ on the ILS XXL approach. This clearance put the aircraft on an intercept to final from the north side of the approach course. At approximately 10-15 nm from ZZZZZ and in IMC; ATC cleared us to descend from 6;500 ft to 5;300 ft MSL. I descended and the aircraft leveled off at 5;300 ft. Shortly thereafter; and still in IMC; we received an aural EGPWS Caution ('CAUTION TERRAIN') followed immediately by an aural EGPWS Warning ('TERRAIN; TERRAIN PULL UP'). I immediately selected TOGA thrust and full back sidestick. Both the CA and I had TERR ON ND selected on our respective instrument panels. I did not observe any solid red or yellow areas on my ND; nor did I observe TERR or OBST AHEAD. The EGPWS Caution and Warning each sounded only the one time; and neither was heard again after initiating the maneuver. While subsequently initiating a level-off; I left TOGA thrust selected too long and allowed airspeed to reach approximately 280 KIAS. The aircraft was clean; so no configuration limits were exceeded; however I still exceeded the 250-KIAS limit below 10;000 MSL. The CA called out my excessive airspeed and I subsequently reduced thrust. The CA had already notified ATC that we were maneuvering in response to the EGPWS Warning. During the process; and while leveling at 6;000 ft. MSL (MSA for the approach); we regained VMC and subsequently coordinated vectors for a visual approach to Runway XXL. A normal approach and landing ensued. Following the EGPWS warning and escape maneuver; ATC advised the CA that the minimum vectoring altitude in our area at the time was 3;800 ft MSL. Based on the fact that we were level at the ATC-assigned altitude of 5;300 ft; above the minimum vectoring altitude; and did not observe any of the expected indications on the CA or FO NDs; I believe this was a false EGPWS warning. That said; in the process of responding to an EGPWS Warning; I allowed airspeed to drop out of my scan with TOGA thrust selected and consequently exceeded 250 KIAS below 10;000 ft MSL.Following the EGPWS warning and escape maneuver; ATC advised the CA that the minimum vectoring altitude in our area at the time was 3;800 feet MSL.

That said; in the process of responding to an EGPWS Warning; I allowed airspeed to drop out of my scan with TOGA thrust selected and consequently exceeded 250 KIAS below 10'000 ft MSL.\nWe started our briefing before our descent into ZZZ...we went over the threats...which included a discussion about mountainous terrain; discussion about the engine out missed approach procedures; and displaying the terrain on our ND.The approach briefing included a briefing on the Minimum Safe Altitudes. Near the end of the STAR; we were initially given direct ZZZZZ; the FAF for XXL. Then we were given vectors to Runway XXL. We were given various step down altitudes by ATC. I don't remember all of them but we were given 6;500 ft. and then a descent to 5;300 ft.We were in Open Descent. We slowed ourselves for the descent and approach to approx. 220 KIAS. We were in a clean configuration. We were well ahead of the aircraft. Somewhere above 5;300 we entered IMC...full overcast layer. We had just leveled at 5;300 ft. when we got a single 'Caution Terrain'.I quickly checked the altimeter and we were level at 5;300 and all flight instruments showed normal for level flight. Almost as quickly we got a single 'Terrain Pull Up' We executed the EGPWS recovery maneuver. We set TOGA thrust and pitched up and started climbing. I notified ATC. During the procedure; ATC stated that the minimum altitude she could descend us to was 3;800 ft.??; I was too busy to remember.Immediately the EGPWS warning stopped (we only got one of each warning). Neither ND showed terrain or warning. All we got were the single two aural warnings. There were no other visual indications. We leveled at approximately 6;000. The EGPWS did not activate any more.We briefly exited out of the clouds around 6;000 and I could visually see ahead. Satisfied that we were clear of terrain I noticed that we had accelerated past 250KIAS...this was because of the recovery maneuver; the TOGA thrust setting; and leveling at 6;000. My focus was directed at climbing and altitude. Once we recognized our airspeed; we corrected our airspeed. Again we were in the clean configuration so no aircraft limitation was exceeded.During the re-vector back to ZZZ; I checked our altimeters with the ATIS; and they were set correctly. Once I was satisfied we were clear of terrain; ATC vectored us back for a visual approach to XXL and landed normally. I believe it was a FALSE EGPWS caution and warning...after the fact.", {"entities": [[764, 781, "AIRPLANE"], [236, 244, "AIRPLANE"], [440, 448, "AIRPLANE"], [1138, 1146, "AIRPLANE"], [3487, 3495, "AIRPLANE"], [4724, 4732, "AIRPLANE"], [533, 538, "ABBREVIATION"], [600, 605, "ABBREVIATION"], [883, 888, "ABBREVIATION"], [1413, 1418, "ABBREVIATION"], [1650, 1655, "ABBREVIATION"], [1999, 2004, "ABBREVIATION"], [2060, 2065, "ABBREVIATION"], [2212, 2217, "ABBREVIATION"], [2564, 2569, "ABBREVIATION"], [2626, 2631, "ABBREVIATION"], [3815, 3820, "ABBREVIATION"], [4055, 4060, "ABBREVIATION"], [4276, 4281, "ABBREVIATION"], [5003, 5008, "ABBREVIATION"], [125, 128, "CREW"], [363, 366, "CREW"], [1365, 1368, "CREW"], [1685, 1688, "CREW"], [1826, 1829, "CREW"], [2247, 2250, "CREW"], [2391, 2394, "CREW"], [3239, 3242, "CREW"], [3907, 3910, "CREW"], [3934, 3937, "CREW"], [4907, 4910, "CREW"], [45, 46, "CREW"], [147, 153, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1586, 1592, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3182, 3188, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [734, 736, "AIRPLANE"], [837, 839, "AIRPLANE"], [1721, 1739, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1879, 1897, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2283, 2301, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2444, 2462, "AVIATION_TERM"], [394, 402, "ALTITUDE"], [3291, 3299, "ALTITUDE"], [422, 431, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [667, 678, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1050, 1061, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2122, 2133, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2688, 2699, "AVIATION_TERM"], [3847, 3858, "AVIATION_TERM"], [4525, 4536, "AVIATION_TERM"], [218, 227, "AVIATION_TERM"], [102, 104, "ABBREVIATION"], [31, 35, "ABBREVIATION"], [1092, 1100, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1293, 1301, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2085, 2093, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2651, 2659, "AVIATION_TERM"], [4640, 4648, "AVIATION_TERM"], [4667, 4675, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1470, 1478, "ALTITUDE"], [4825, 4829, "ABBREVIATION"], [195, 198, "ABBREVIATION"], [55, 57, "ABBREVIATION"], [7, 14, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2800, 2807, "AVIATION_TERM"], [3312, 3319, "AVIATION_TERM"], [3385, 3392, "AVIATION_TERM"], [406, 414, "ALTITUDE"], [464, 472, "ALTITUDE"], [1851, 1859, "ALTITUDE"], [2416, 2424, "ALTITUDE"], [3323, 3331, "ALTITUDE"], [3580, 3588, "ALTITUDE"], [85, 92, "CREW"], [3091, 3095, "ABBREVIATION"], [358, 361, "ABBREVIATION"], [507, 510, "ABBREVIATION"], [3530, 3533, "ABBREVIATION"], [81, 83, "ABBREVIATION"], [106, 122, "CREW"], [203, 211, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [297, 305, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1497, 1505, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1574, 1582, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1607, 1615, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2940, 2948, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3002, 3010, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3397, 3405, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4941, 4949, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1768, 1776, "ALTITUDE"], [3999, 4007, "ALTITUDE"], [1128, 1132, "ABBREVIATION"], [1233, 1237, "ABBREVIATION"], [2173, 2177, "ABBREVIATION"], [2739, 2743, "ABBREVIATION"], [3421, 3425, "ABBREVIATION"], [4471, 4475, "ABBREVIATION"], [1250, 1256, "ALTITUDE"], [2184, 2190, "ALTITUDE"], [693, 702, "AIRPLANE"], [3139, 3142, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [1485, 1488, "ABBREVIATION"], [415, 418, "ABBREVIATION"], [1257, 1260, "ABBREVIATION"], [1480, 1483, "ABBREVIATION"], [1777, 1780, "ABBREVIATION"], [2194, 2197, "ABBREVIATION"], [2341, 2344, "ABBREVIATION"], [2760, 2763, "ABBREVIATION"], [1964, 1966, "ABBREVIATION"], [2529, 2531, "ABBREVIATION"], [59, 71, "CREW"]]}],
["During preflight planning discovered this was the third airplane assigned to the flight. Arrived at the aircraft and discussed two MEL (Minimum Equipment List) items which we reviewed together and called Maintenance out to clarify an item. All four pilots handled and reviewed the logbook during this discussion. We all briefed the ETOPS (Extended Twin Operations) signoff and agreed it was done and in the book. The boarding was slightly delayed so there was no pressure to get things done quickly. After about two hours into cruise Dispatch sent a message asking if the ETOPS signoff was in the logbook. I checked it and found that there was indeed an entry and it was the correct date but saw that the departure station was ZZZZ. This means that the signoff was for the previous leg which was the day before. The day before; in the other hemisphere. We all were looking for an ETOPS date and we all saw what we expected to see. At that point we were not in ETOPS airspace and worked out a routing with Dispatch that avoided ETOPS airspace entirely and secured the clearances with ATC (Air Traffic Control). Shortly after Dispatch told us that the maintenance department wanted us to return the airplane to ZZZ. We asked to divert to minimize the delay to the passengers but were told to return to ZZZ. The return to ZZZ required and overweight landing at 485;000 lbs (max landing weight is 460;000 lbs); so ATC was advised. All checklists were complete and an uneventful landing was made.I think all pilots expected to see an ETOPS signoff dated [the same day] and that is exactly what we saw. We should have reviewed the entry more carefully. There was no reason as we were not rushing to depart; we just missed the fact that the last leg originated in the other hemisphere.I need to inspect the logbook entries more carefully and make sure I know where the previous leg originated; especially when a change of equipment is involved. I never suspected the date line issue would cause such a problem but it happened.\nFlight departing ZZZ to ZZZZ. Aircraft changed tail number two times before departure. Logbook was reviewed by Flight Crew and Maintenance was called to the aircraft to clarify an MEL (Minimum Equipment List) item. Flight crew incorrectly verified ETOPS (Extended twin Operations) signoff in the AML (Aircraft Maintenance Log). ETOPS was signed off on the correct date; however; the ETOPS was signed off in ZZZZ; not ZZZ.Lack of awareness that is was possible; although unusual; that an ETOPS could be signed off in ZZZZ and need an additional ETOPS sign off to go back to ZZZZ from ZZZ in the same day.I believe that awareness of this unusual event would prevent it from reoccurring.", {"entities": [[249, 255, "CREW"], [1503, 1509, "CREW"], [534, 542, "CREW"], [1005, 1013, "CREW"], [1124, 1132, "CREW"], [966, 974, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1033, 1041, "AVIATION_TERM"], [527, 533, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [705, 722, "AVIATION_TERM"], [56, 64, "AIRPLANE"], [1197, 1205, "AIRPLANE"], [2067, 2078, "AIRPLANE"], [281, 288, "AVIATION_TERM"], [597, 604, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1800, 1807, "AVIATION_TERM"], [10, 16, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [81, 87, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [204, 215, "CREW"], [2147, 2158, "CREW"], [2330, 2341, "CREW"], [339, 363, "AVIATION_TERM"], [136, 158, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2205, 2227, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1431, 1441, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1083, 1086, "CREW"], [1410, 1413, "CREW"], [1347, 1354, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1375, 1382, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1474, 1481, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2316, 2319, "ABBREVIATION"], [131, 134, "ABBREVIATION"], [2200, 2203, "ABBREVIATION"], [332, 337, "ABBREVIATION"], [572, 577, "ABBREVIATION"], [880, 885, "ABBREVIATION"], [960, 965, "ABBREVIATION"], [1027, 1032, "ABBREVIATION"], [1529, 1534, "ABBREVIATION"], [2268, 2273, "ABBREVIATION"], [2348, 2353, "ABBREVIATION"], [2403, 2408, "ABBREVIATION"], [2507, 2512, "ABBREVIATION"], [2564, 2569, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

["My student and I were on a discovery flight; we were on the west side of Key Biscayne about 1.5 miles west of the island flying south bound at 1;200 ft. MSL. We had been actively searching for traffic; and noticed another aircraft about 500 ft. lower than our altitude flying south bound as well. However; that aircraft then made a climbing 180 degree turn; then flying directly towards us; my student advised me that the aircraft was getting closer and continued climbing in our direction. I did not have visual of the aircraft and for a moment my student also lost sight of the aircraft. At that moment I then decided to take evasive action and immediately began to climb to stay safe and to evade a near miss or a mid air collision. When my student caught sight of the aircraft again it was flying west bound in a direction that put him right below us. I was able to finally see the aircraft flying west bound about 200 to 300 ft. below us and continuing to fly away from us. At that moment I leveled off the aircraft to notice that I had violated the MIA class B airspace that starts at 1;500 ft. MSL . I'm not sure if we climbed up to 1;700 ft. MSL but I do know that I had climbed to at least 1;600 hft. I immediately descended below the MIA B airspace. As I acknowledge that I had violated the B airspace.

["Aircraft X checked on frequency level at 8500 southeast of Freeport. I was busy with a west flow out of South Florida; continual flashing on the scope from data blocks associated with the Fighter Cap due to TFR at PBI. Freeport frequencies; VOR and Radar are still damaged from hurricane Dorian with no fix in sight. Traffic was heavy with departure traffic and overflights from the island. Aircraft X [advises that he has engine problems]; he was partially blocked due to high traffic volume and being on our LOW frequency. I confirmed it was him and got a range/baring for Freeport airport (MYGF). I asked the nature of the [problem] and he said that the 'engine was running rough and vibrating violently.' I continued to work traffic and give him some time to assess the [problem]. Asked for fuel on board; souls on board. Told him to pitch for best glide. The pilot stated that they still had power but very rough; they thought they had lost their #6 piston; or it had stopped functioning. I asked the FLM (Front Line Manager) that was trying to leave the area to please call Freeport tower and advise. We have no way to communicate on sector with Freeport tower because the MEVA PABX line has been down since Hurricane Dorian. Our PABX line with telephone number to Freeport tower was also INOP. The pilot stated they were going to continue under rough power to circle down over Freeport. I continued to call the airport and advise they were landing west due to prevailing winds. Finally a FLM from another area came and I told to call Freeport and advise of the situation. I called multiple times for a D-side to assist as I still had the heavy traffic load. Finally got a D-side to help me with everything. Supervisor from Coastal got a hold of Freeport Tower and gave me the winds and runway info. I relayed to pilot who stated he had in sight and would make the runway; they spiraled down and I switched to Freeport tower frequency. The pilot was able to land safely with the 4 people on board.We need our frequencies; radar; MEVA and PABX lines back on Freeport. No communication exists and we are operating a ton of traffic into and out of the airport along with multiple airline flights a day that are being required to cancel IFR as there are no procedures set up between us and ZFP approach.

["Aircraft X was inbound to the airport from the southeast. Apparently the aircraft was on an IFR flight plan and I completely overlooked that information. It took the aircraft traveling about 10 miles inside my airspace before the pilot called and made first contact with me. When the pilot finally called me and told me he had the current ATIS I had asked the pilot which route he wanted to take inbound to North Las Vegas airport. Again; I failed to look at all the information in the data block and treated him as if he was VFR. When I asked the pilot which route he wanted and he was open to either route; I gave the aircraft a clearance through the Class Bravo airspace and assigned a heading of 270 with no altitude assigned. A minute or so later I asked the pilot if he was familiar with the local flying area and the surrounding terrain; and after he replied in the affirmative; I instructed the pilot to resume own navigation then fly heading 360.After I got that read back; I instructed the pilot to cross the airport at and maintain 5;000 feet. A few minutes later as he approached the airport from the southeast and was approximately 6 miles to the southeast and over a 6;300 Minimum Vectoring Altitude. I had noticed there were numerous VFR departures departing southbound; so I assigned a heading of 320 to stay away from the targets I saw departing. At this time the pilot had already begun his descent to comply with the VFR instructions that I had issued; and never mentioned that he was IFR. As stated before I didn't realize he was IFR. I had made a couple traffic calls regarding the departing aircraft who were not Radar identified; and at that time a Controller a few positions over mentioned the altitude of Aircraft X and that was the first time I noticed the data block and all the information that I initially missed indicating that he was in fact IFR. At that point The aircraft was already at 5;500 feet heading northwest bound; and it was at this point that I and the Supervisor talked about the aircraft and the situation at hand.I don't know that there are any recommendations or changes that can or should be made to prevent this from happening again in the future. I simply missed the information in the data block indicating that this aircraft was IFR. When I issued a Class Bravo clearance and all appropriate navigation and altitude instructions for a VFR aircraft; I had the expectation bias that the aircraft was indeed VFR when he accepted all the instructions and never questioned the clearance. I missed the indicators that he was on an IFR flight plan and there is nothing more to it and completely my fault and no one else's.", {"entities": [[1264, 1273, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1353, 1362, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1603, 1612, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [689, 696, "AVIATION_TERM"], [943, 950, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1302, 1309, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1931, 1938, "AVIATION_TERM"], [73, 81, "AIRPLANE"], [166, 174, "AIRPLANE"], [620, 628, "AIRPLANE"], [1613, 1621, "AIRPLANE"], [1896, 1904, "AIRPLANE"], [2024, 2032, "AIRPLANE"], [2268, 2276, "AIRPLANE"], [2391, 2399, "AIRPLANE"], [2437, 2445, "AIRPLANE"], [210, 218, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [665, 673, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [96, 107, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2581, 2592, "AVIATION_TERM"], [92, 95, "ABBREVIATION"], [1504, 1507, "ABBREVIATION"], [1550, 1553, "ABBREVIATION"], [1873, 1876, "ABBREVIATION"], [2281, 2284, "ABBREVIATION"], [2577, 2580, "ABBREVIATION"], [1920, 1930, "ALTITUDE"], [339, 343, "ABBREVIATION"], [230, 235, "CREW"], [284, 289, "CREW"], [360, 365, "CREW"], [548, 553, "CREW"], [764, 769, "CREW"], [903, 908, "CREW"], [1000, 1005, "CREW"], [1381, 1386, "CREW"], [526, 529, "ABBREVIATION"], [1249, 1252, "ABBREVIATION"], [1436, 1439, "ABBREVIATION"], [2387, 2390, "ABBREVIATION"], [2457, 2460, "ABBREVIATION"], [0, 8, "AIRPLANE"], [1730, 1738, "AIRPLANE"], [15, 22, "AVIATION_TERM"], [396, 403, "AVIATION_TERM"], [407, 430, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [271, 273, "CREW"], [305, 307, "CREW"], [317, 319, "CREW"], [916, 918, "CREW"], [1409, 1416, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [30, 37, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1019, 1026, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1096, 1103, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1672, 1682, "CREW"], [712, 720, "ALTITUDE"], [1718, 1726, "ALTITUDE"], [2359, 2367, "ALTITUDE"], [1043, 1053, "ALTITUDE"], [631, 640, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2314, 2323, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2524, 2533, "AVIATION_TERM"]]}],
["ZDC was inundated with moderate to severe turbulence associated with a cold front.  We received GI messages for severe turbulence in ZDC Areas 6 and 5 (XA05Z FL180-190 at MOL; XA25Z 140-FL210 at CSN; XA43Z FL210 at LDN; XA51Z 170 at MRB); which we assumed would mean that the front that was traveling northeast bound; toward us; would eventually provide Area 1 with the same conditions. The controllers at sector 17 and 12 coordinated directly with the sectors behind them to re-route PHL aircraft over SWL for the JIIMS arrival instead of BUKYY; and we then asked our supervisor to advise TMU of this coordination. As the part of the front approached BUKYY that had been getting severe reports; our supervisor asked if we could take a pathfinder through the front because Area 4 was being inundated with PHL arrivals that they were not originally projected to get.  I was training a D-side at sectors 18/19 starting around XC00Z; where we work arrivals to TEB (JAIKE); EWR (PHLBO); and LGA (KORRY). We were supposed to be complying with a 15MIT restriction to EWR and a 20MIT restriction for JAIKE. Our R-side was receiving 20MIT from the sector behind us for EWR and 25MIT for JAIKE; which is our standard feed. Due to the winds; our R-side was vectoring to attempt to give the next sectors those mileages; but was unable to do so. Our EWR arrivals were unable to comply with the 'descend via' restrictions; and also needed to be vectored not only for the MIT but in order to get the arrivals low enough into the next sector at all. My D-side trainee was doing point-outs for the vectored aircraft; and we asked our Supervisor to put in reports for moderate turbulence; which all aircraft were getting between 170-FL250. We also advised our Supervisor three times that he needed to coordinate with Area 2 to provide at least 35MIT for our area on JAIKE arrivals and 25MIT for EWR arrivals. This was only communicated on the fourth attempt; when our R-side stood up and shouted at the Area 2 supervisor that 'We NEED 35MIT for JAIKE arrivals!!!' The Area 2 supervisor reported not having heard anything about this requested restriction. Eventually in the night; I did work the R-side at sector 12; and I was personally providing 30-35MIT at FL250 and 250 kts for all EWR arrivals; and sector 18/19 was barely capable of keeping 15MIT even with an added 20MIT restriction. Around XD00Z; our D-side training was suspended and I was assigned to relieve the Controller at sectors 17/11. The Controller I relieved advised me he had shut off COLIN departures southbound and J42 departures northbound due to moderate to severe turbulence. Within 10 minutes of sitting at the sector; I had aircraft departing on both of those routes. Once the aircraft departed the airports; the only way to get them out of the turbulence was to get them above FL250; and I was not going to make PCT KRANT hold aircraft in known severe turbulence. I called KRANT to advise that we would accept no more aircraft due to continuous moderate to severe turbulence. I was relieved from that sector by XD15Z; where the relieving Controller ended up having a priority handling situation due to severe turbulence and at least three more reports northbound. Within 10 minutes of our D-side training being terminated; the Controller at sectors 18/19 requested a D-side again; as JAIKE arrivals started to report severe turbulence. The Controller had the sector behind hold JAIKE arrivals due to severe turbulence. 1. 'As the part of the front approached BUKYY that had been getting severe reports; our supervisor asked if we could take a pathfinder through the front because Area 4 was being inundated with PHL arrivals that they were not originally projected to get.' Our TMU should have put restrictions out for other traffic entering sector 54 to avoid this being an issue; or routed PHL traffic earlier to have a more cohesive flow BEFORE they h ad to be sequenced in sector 54. The answer should NOT have been attempting to put any aircraft through known areas of moderate to severe turbulence. 2. 'We received GI messages for severe turbulence in ZDC Areas 6 and 5 (XA05Z FL180-190 at MOL; XA25Z 140-FL210 at CSN; XA43Z FL210 at LDN; XA51Z 170 at MRB); which we assumed would mean that the front that was traveling northeast bound; toward us; would eventually provide Area 1 with the same conditions.' In Area 1; we did not have severe turbulence begin until the XC00Z hour. There should have been restrictions in play to route aircraft away from the turbulence as soon as the ZDC powers-that-be realized that this was going to continue as the front traveled eastbound. 3. 'The Controller I relieved advised me he had shut off COLIN departures southbound and J42 departures northbound due to moderate to severe turbulence. Within 10 minutes of sitting at the sector; I had aircraft departing on both of those routes.' I have no idea why this happened. This was communicated both through our supervisor; presumably then through TMU; and PCT KRANT sector. NO departures should have come out beyond that point. 4. 'Within 10 minutes of our D-side training being terminated; the Controller at sectors 18/19 requested a D-side again; as JAIKE arrivals started to report severe turbulence.' Either (A) we should have never been removed from the sector; or (B) a D-side should have been paged back before I was assigned to relieve the Controller at sectors 17/11. 5.

["I was working local control in a south operation. I had Aircraft Y holding in position on RWY19 with Aircraft X on final for RWY19. There was a small layer of clouds in between the buildings in Rosslyn and the Kennedy Center (our 2 mile final visual landmark). This small area of clouds did not prevent the aircraft from seeing the runway; and none of the previous aircraft on final disappeared from my view. During this operation; shortly after putting Aircraft Y in position; Aircraft X disappeared into the cloud just as they were passing the buildings over Rosslyn. I cleared Aircraft Y knowing that Aircraft X was somewhere between a two and three mile final. I could not tell exactly where Aircraft X was because they were behind a cloud that blocked my sight; but they were still showing outside of two miles on the radar. When I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff; I said 'traffic is inside of a three mile final'. Shortly after takeoff roll; Aircraft X came out of the clouds and I saw they were inside of a two mile final. At that point I knew this may be an operation that I may not have runway separation minimums. I asked Aircraft X to square his last turn if able; to try to achieve the 6;000 ft and airborne. A few seconds after that I could tell this would not work and issued go-around instructions to Aircraft X on what I would estimate to be just inside of a half mile final. His instructions were to turn right to a heading of 250 and maintain 3;000 ft. He read back correctly; but did not turn and flew over top the runway while climbing. I then issued an instruction to turn right to a 270 heading to ensure separation from Aircraft Y departing.  Even after this; I observed Aircraft X continuing on runway heading. I then issued traffic and told him to turn immediately. After this; he finally started to turn. I would estimate that Aircraft X flew at least 2 miles after I issued the initial go-around heading before they started their turn.  I recommend that I could have issued a traffic alert and said to turn immediately earlier than I did. I also think that I could have held on to the departing aircraft longer and turned them eastbound to ensure diverging headings from the trailing go-around aircraft that was issued a westbound turn. In my experience; it is not the norm in a go-around for an aircraft to fly for so long after being issued a turn; to not turn. I am not a pilot myself; so I'm not sure what is considered a reasonable amount of time to 'clean up' the airplane while going around. Again; I from what I've experienced; this is not the norm. I would even consider this to potentially be a deviation.", {"entities": [[115, 120, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [237, 242, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [377, 382, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [658, 663, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [911, 916, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1022, 1027, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1384, 1389, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1460, 1468, "ALTITUDE"], [2511, 2523, "AVIATION_TERM"], [194, 201, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [561, 568, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [860, 867, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1432, 1439, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1608, 1615, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1725, 1732, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1922, 1929, "AVIATION_TERM"], [67, 86, "AVIATION_TERM"], [307, 315, "AIRPLANE"], [365, 373, "AIRPLANE"], [2121, 2129, "AIRPLANE"], [2220, 2228, "AIRPLANE"], [2322, 2330, "AIRPLANE"], [1197, 1205, "ALTITUDE"], [159, 165, "WEATHER"], [280, 286, "WEATHER"], [974, 980, "WEATHER"], [823, 828, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2496, 2504, "AIRPLANE"], [2401, 2406, "CREW"], [1546, 1554, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [332, 338, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1095, 1101, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1533, 1539, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1718, 1724, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [877, 884, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1748, 1755, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2002, 2009, "AVIATION_TERM"], [210, 224, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [1102, 1121, "AVIATION_TERM"], [56, 64, "AIRPLANE"], [101, 109, "AIRPLANE"], [454, 462, "AIRPLANE"], [478, 486, "AIRPLANE"], [580, 588, "AIRPLANE"], [604, 612, "AIRPLANE"], [696, 704, "AIRPLANE"], [845, 853, "AIRPLANE"], [947, 955, "AIRPLANE"], [1131, 1139, "AIRPLANE"], [1315, 1323, "AIRPLANE"], [1642, 1650, "AIRPLANE"], [1693, 1701, "AIRPLANE"], [1852, 1860, "AIRPLANE"], [0, 1, "CREW"], [50, 51, "CREW"], [570, 571, "CREW"], [665, 666, "CREW"], [835, 836, "CREW"], [869, 870, "CREW"], [985, 986, "CREW"], [1043, 1044, "CREW"], [1080, 1081, "CREW"], [1123, 1124, "CREW"], [1245, 1246, "CREW"], [1334, 1335, "CREW"], [1556, 1557, "CREW"], [1682, 1683, "CREW"], [1734, 1735, "CREW"], [1830, 1831, "CREW"], [1891, 1892, "CREW"], [1963, 1964, "CREW"], [1980, 1981, "CREW"], [2058, 2059, "CREW"], [2065, 2066, "CREW"], [2083, 2084, "CREW"], [90, 95, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [125, 130, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [933, 945, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1289, 1298, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1912, 1921, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2210, 2219, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2305, 2314, "AVIATION_TERM"]]}],

["I am writing this report to bring attention to the second departure frequency out of MDW last night.

These takeoffs are known to have very high climb rates; so the intermediate level-off of 3;000 feet approaches fast. At 1;000 feet; we're instructed to contact Departure on 128.2. Simultaneously; I switch frequencies and retract flaps as commanded by the pilot flying. Upon checking in with 128.2; he instructs us to climb and maintain 4;000 feet and subsequently contact 126.62. I dial in 4;000 feet and continue to retract flaps while monitoring a level-off from a climb rate of over 2;000 FPM. At this point; my head turns down to the radio to dial the new Departure frequency in. I check in and they tell us to climb and maintain 12;000 feet. I dial in 12;000 feet; confirm it; reset the autobrake and gear lever; then reconfigure the bleeds.

["Ceilings were sufficient for CAT I approach; but very close to minimums. On final; Approach and Tower issued wake turbulence advisory for heavy Airbus in front of us (6-7 miles) per TCAS. As First Officer Pilot Flying approach was stable (autopilot engaged). Approach light system was acquired just above minimums; and then runway/markings/lighting was acquired prior to 100 feet per FOM. I stated 'Continue' instead of 'landing' due to lights vs runway contrary to the FOM; creating a challenge from PM (CA) to confirm my intentions. Past the threshold (below 50 feet); the aircraft began to roll and was pushed slightly left of centerline due to wake turbulence. I rolled the aircraft back and attempted to correct back to centerline. I accepted a landing slightly left of centerline and the landing rollout was uneventful. After landing; ACARS data reflected a 5.0 degree bank on landing (maximum 7.5). In hindsight; a go-around would have been a better choice.\nWe were cautioned following heavy on ILS 8L. We saw we were 5 miles in trail. Per FOM since it was First Officer's leg we briefed the ILS CAT1 approach and back up CAT3. When we left [departure airport]; forecast was well above CAT 1. RVR was 2;000; so we briefed that just prior to FAF get final RVR and if need be switch to CAT 3 change mins from CAT 1 barometric to CAT 3 radio alt mins and Captain take control. Second auto pilot was turned on when approach clearance given.At about 50 feet; I observed the nose come up slightly and I thought First Officer was starting flare early although very small up nose. Then at about 30 feet; we got a roll input which the First Officer countered and we rolled in opposite direction and drifted well left of center line. As I was about to call go around; the First Officer stabilized the situation and we landed left of centerline. It was by no means a hard landing in vertical drop and roll was stable. However much to my surprise when we checked post report on roll it showed 5 degrees with wingtip contact at 7.5. I would never thought it was that close to wing contact.Post shut down debrief reveal the first error on my part was engaging second autopilot when a First Officer non autoland was planned. Looking up in FM second autopilot can be turned on NLT 800 feet. This should have been delayed until decision to change to CAT if needed prior to FAF. This caused aircraft to trim nose up and it was that nose up trim the First Officer was fighting when he turned autopilot off. Second now that I have a better 'picture' of what excessive roll looks like a go-around should have been called.I can say though had RVR dropped and it was an autoland the first rolling movement would definitely command a go-around as an auto and would not have been successful.", {"entities": [[239, 248, "AIRPLANE"], [2160, 2169, "AIRPLANE"], [2241, 2250, "AIRPLANE"], [2480, 2489, "AIRPLANE"], [2272, 2280, "ALTITUDE"], [794, 809, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1594, 1601, "ALTITUDE"], [1129, 1133, "AVIATION_TERM"], [109, 124, "AVIATION_TERM"], [648, 663, "AVIATION_TERM"], [384, 387, "ABBREVIATION"], [470, 473, "ABBREVIATION"], [1047, 1050, "ABBREVIATION"], [2195, 2203, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2654, 2662, "AVIATION_TERM"], [76, 81, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1256, 1261, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [331, 339, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [0, 8, "WEATHER"], [1200, 1203, "ABBREVIATION"], [1262, 1265, "ABBREVIATION"], [2628, 2631, "ABBREVIATION"], [340, 348, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [922, 931, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2573, 2582, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2717, 2726, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1388, 1398, "AIRPLANE"], [1754, 1763, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [389, 390, "CREW"], [665, 666, "CREW"], [737, 738, "CREW"], [1002, 1005, "ABBREVIATION"], [1099, 1102, "ABBREVIATION"], [421, 428, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [750, 757, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [832, 839, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [883, 890, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1868, 1875, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1006, 1008, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [191, 204, "CREW"], [1064, 1077, "CREW"], [1512, 1525, "CREW"], [1633, 1646, "CREW"], [1769, 1782, "CREW"], [2177, 2190, "CREW"], [2438, 2451, "CREW"], [96, 101, "CREW"], [371, 379, "ALTITUDE"], [182, 186, "ABBREVIATION"], [1248, 1251, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [2363, 2366, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [841, 846, "ABBREVIATION"], [1359, 1366, "CREW"], [29, 43, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [268, 280, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [144, 150, "AIRPLANE"], [324, 330, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [447, 453, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [83, 91, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [259, 267, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2231, 2233, "ABBREVIATION"], [630, 640, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [725, 735, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [775, 785, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1830, 1840, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [501, 503, "CREW"], [205, 217, "CREW"], [561, 568, "ALTITUDE"], [1452, 1459, "ALTITUDE"], [575, 583, "AIRPLANE"], [678, 686, "AIRPLANE"], [2380, 2388, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
["This report is largely informational. To the best of my knowledge no flight deck crew member did anything wrong; nor was there any malfunction.  While reviewing the paperwork for this flight I noticed the maintenance release form listed a previous leg's multi bird strike which was fully signed off by Maintenance. The corrective action by Maintenance mentioned that bird parts/feathers may have been ingested into the engine. I mentally noted this; and watched the engine closely during start; taxi; and power-up for takeoff. The entire time the engine and all aircraft systems were entirely and completely normal. In the middle of the takeoff roll (above 100 knots) myself and the First Officer both noticed a strange smell but since absolutely everything was functioning normally we continued. One of the flight attendants called the flight deck at around 500 feet; in the climb saying they smelled something and they were concerned. We assured them we were safe and we would call them back shortly. By 1;000 feet in the climb the smell dissipated and went away completely; all systems were normal; the engines were purring contentedly; and we had no indication of anything wrong at all. Although I was ready to turn back to ZZZ immediately there was no reason to; since there was nothing wrong. We continued the climb; and at a reasonable altitude I called the flight attendants back and explained that everything was absolutely fine; we were going to continue to ZZZ1; and I suspected the strange smell was burning bird feathers from the bird strike. They accepted this and we continued to ZZZ1 without incident. At the gate before deplaning I asked the flight attendants (as I do every leg) if they needed anything further from me. They said no; so I proceeded to the next gate for my next flight.  Just before pushing off the gate for the next leg; Operations and Maintenance called me asking for an explanation for the earlier smells which the previous flight attendants had apparently communicated to them. Maintenance asked me to fill out a 2-page questionnaire which I completed and handed back to them before my next departure. None of the questions on their forms were relevant but I answered them to the best of my ability anyway; then provided a written statement on the back to explain what happened. They seemed satisfied with this and we went our separate ways.  In summary; with the information we had in front of us; we had no reason to believe there was anything wrong with that aircraft at any time from the time we left the gate in ZZZ to the point of setting the brakes at the gate in ZZZ1. With the information we had there was no reason to abort the takeoff; and there was no reason to air-return. The First Officer and I were in complete agreement on this; the cabin crew was kept informed; and safety was never in question. It is not uncommon to smell strange things for brief periods of time on our flights in general; and we assess things and make appropriate decisions. It is possible that there was something else wrong with the airplane and that the information provided about the bird strike led me to a false conclusion; in which case a maintenance write-up may have proven useful. I did not write it up because to the best of my knowledge; given the information provided to me both through the maintenance log and all physical evidence in front of me; there was never actually anything wrong.  As an aside; I am curious about how or why the flight attendants communicated this to maintenance without communicating with me first. Their concerns and input are always valid; however I did not think this was our procedure.", {"entities": [[518, 525, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2676, 2683, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [302, 313, "CREW"], [340, 351, "CREW"], [1871, 1882, "CREW"], [2016, 2027, "CREW"], [2788, 2798, "CREW"], [562, 578, "AIRPLANE"], [495, 499, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [657, 666, "AVIATION_TERM"], [859, 867, "ALTITUDE"], [260, 271, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1543, 1554, "AVIATION_TERM"], [3114, 3125, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1625, 1629, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1779, 1783, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1833, 1837, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2547, 2551, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2601, 2605, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [488, 493, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [191, 192, "CREW"], [427, 428, "CREW"], [683, 696, "CREW"], [2728, 2741, "CREW"], [205, 216, "CREW"], [3172, 3183, "CREW"], [3330, 3341, "CREW"], [3516, 3527, "CREW"], [248, 251, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1692, 1695, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1851, 1854, "AVIATION_TERM"], [876, 881, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1024, 1029, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1316, 1321, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [69, 85, "CREW"], [808, 825, "CREW"], [1365, 1382, "CREW"], [1659, 1676, "CREW"], [1961, 1978, "CREW"], [3477, 3494, "CREW"], [1006, 1016, "ALTITUDE"], [637, 649, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [419, 425, "AIRPLANE"], [466, 472, "AIRPLANE"], [547, 553, "AIRPLANE"], [1817, 1828, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

It was not possible to do this via exiting the cold cloud; either up or down. We were at 280 kts. and descending. I could not remember the SAT to TAT equation off the top of my head (a check of Google says TAT = SAT + (TAS/100)^2); but I did recall the main point; that it was in proportion to the square of the speed. Therefore; a small change in TAS would result in a large swing in TAT; allowing us to directly control the TAT as limited by the SAT and the speed envelope of the airplane. (Per the equation; 300 kts. = a nine-degree increase; 400 = 16; 450 = 20.25; etc. There is little change at speeds below M 0.2).I immediately called for the FO (First Officer) to increase speed to 320 kts. in order to increase the TAT. (I had no time to explain why until later. He complied immediately; though. Nice work). We were out of icing conditions forthwith. And so we remained; but had to exceed 250 kts. below 10000 ft. in order to do so. This required [us to advise ATC]. As we got lower we were able to maintain adequate TAT at normal speeds; and so cancelled the [event] before landing.I wanted to have a viable plan in case I was unable to stay out of ice on the approach. We got weather for the alternate from ATC. It was no good for our purpose. I asked Dispatch for the best/closest ice-free airport in my fuel range; and concurred with his recommendation of ZZZ. We informed ATC of that contingency. I was prepared to continue with my desired speed and altitude per emergency authority if necessary. ATC was very helpful; and I'm sure we could have worked it out quickly.We did not run TEST items with the flight attendants. I was pretty sure the issue would be gone before landing; it did not involve the cabin; and I was way more interested in their normal procedures for the CAT II at that point. I did make the regular CAT II announcement on schedule.ATC reported negative ice from aircraft in front of us on the approach. We flew cowls/no wings with a TAT of seven to nine-ish on final. It was above 10 below about 500 ft. I flew the CAT II; of course. We broke out just below CAT I mins and landed normally.[Maintenance] showed that both loops detected a leak along the right side of the fuselage.", {"entities": [[143, 146, "ABBREVIATION"], [363, 366, "ABBREVIATION"], [292, 298, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2208, 2214, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2253, 2259, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2469, 2475, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1317, 1324, "AVIATION_TERM"], [4, 12, "AIRPLANE"], [87, 95, "AIRPLANE"], [509, 516, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1069, 1071, "ABBREVIATION"], [472, 477, "WEATHER"], [308, 314, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [324, 337, "AIRPLANE"], [566, 569, "ABBREVIATION"], [626, 629, "ABBREVIATION"], [805, 808, "ABBREVIATION"], [846, 849, "ABBREVIATION"], [1143, 1146, "ABBREVIATION"], [1445, 1448, "ABBREVIATION"], [2387, 2390, "ABBREVIATION"], [2624, 2632, "AIRPLANE"], [1109, 1116, "AVIATION_TERM"], [162, 165, "WEATHER"], [639, 642, "ABBREVIATION"], [768, 771, "ABBREVIATION"], [53, 60, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1389, 1392, "CREW"], [1637, 1640, "CREW"], [1805, 1808, "CREW"], [1930, 1933, "CREW"], [2285, 2288, "CREW"], [2450, 2456, "ALTITUDE"], [1332, 1340, "ALTITUDE"], [931, 938, "AVIATION_TERM"], [559, 562, "ABBREVIATION"], [632, 635, "ABBREVIATION"], [868, 871, "ABBREVIATION"], [257, 263, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2036, 2042, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
["During climbout with Houston departure we were given a phone number to call for 'possible pilot deviation.' After landing; Captain spoke with a Controller from Houston Center that informed him that we initially checked in at 2;200 feet climbing to 16;000 feet (the final altitude on the SID) when the initial altitude for the departure was supposed to be 5;000 feet. At that point we re-examined the chart and failed to find the 5;000 feet initial climb limitation; after being put on hold we then informed that the information was contained in the PDC strip. We then located the PDC printout and confirmed that we were cleared on the departure and it said the 'maintain 5;000 feet.' The altitude restriction was not crossed because we received a clearance to climb to 16;000 feet upon checking in at 2;200 feet. ATC also informed us that this is a somewhat common occurrence on this departure.Unfamiliarity with the airport and departure (first time at HOU) caused more time to be spent analyzing the taxi chart and SID chart to ensure compliance with taxi instructions as well as the listed initial climb inset and top altitude. The Tower Controller gave us a heading of 350 on the takeoff clearance but did not mention an altitude.Since according to ATC this is a somewhat common occurrence an additional mention by Tower of any climb restriction or heading not listed on the SID would help air crews ensure compliance during the climbout. If the 5;000 foot crossing restriction is used the majority of the time; it can be listed in the chart as well.", {"entities": [[917, 924, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [271, 279, "ALTITUDE"], [309, 317, "ALTITUDE"], [688, 696, "ALTITUDE"], [1121, 1129, "ALTITUDE"], [1225, 1233, "ALTITUDE"], [954, 957, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [248, 259, "ALTITUDE"], [769, 780, "ALTITUDE"], [29, 38, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [326, 335, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [635, 644, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [884, 893, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [929, 938, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7, 15, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1433, 1441, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [355, 365, "ALTITUDE"], [429, 439, "ALTITUDE"], [671, 681, "ALTITUDE"], [287, 290, "ABBREVIATION"], [1017, 1020, "ABBREVIATION"], [1379, 1382, "ABBREVIATION"], [114, 121, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [448, 464, "AVIATION_TERM"], [123, 130, "CREW"], [1162, 1169, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1353, 1360, "AVIATION_TERM"], [90, 95, "CREW"], [225, 235, "ALTITUDE"], [801, 811, "ALTITUDE"], [21, 28, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [160, 167, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [813, 816, "CREW"], [1253, 1256, "CREW"], [144, 154, "CREW"], [1141, 1151, "CREW"], [400, 405, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1007, 1012, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1021, 1026, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1540, 1545, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1184, 1201, "AVIATION_TERM"]]}],
["Day 3 IOE with a new hire. 4th leg of tour after recurrent and vacation. While in cruise at FL350 white HYD SYS FAULT displayed. Shortly after; white ENG NO DISPATCH displayed. We reviewed both CAS messages in the QRH; MEL; POH and decided to continue flight. A few minutes later the L ENG failed and an Amber E1 FAIL displayed on the L N1 gauge.  Performed INFLIGHT ENGINE SHUTDOWN QRC; Then QRH NON-ANNUNCIATED ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE IN ICING CONDITIONS and then NAP ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE APPROACH AND LANDING QRH. Some point in the middle of all this I put the autopilot on and transferred the controls so I could call the operations. I spoke with the Person X and briefed him on the plan to divert to ZZZ. He transferred me to [Person Y] in ZZZ1 who gave me NOTAMs; WX and landing performance numbers. In the mean time; [the new hire] was handling ATC and flying the plane toward ZZZ. We [advised ATC] immediately and asked for [airport services] upon arrival. Landed uneventfully and taxied to the FBO.Be ready when you come back to work; especially after an extended period of time off. I'd been off the line for 5 weeks with recurrent and vacation. Training and instincts took over. Having a professional and highly competent crew member assisting me made a huge difference during this event. SIC was outstanding!\nWhile in cruise flight at FL350; I was alerted to an advisory CAS message 'HYD SYS FAULT'. A few seconds after that fault I was alerted to an advisory CAS message 'NO ENG DISPATCH'. I looked up the CAS messages in the QRH and POH. I read that they were 'crew awareness' messages only and they were related to certain aircraft systems. There were no procedures to perform related to these CAS messages. Within a few minutes of the advisory CAS message I felt; and heard the Number One Engine power reduce and I was then alerted to a cautionary CAS message 'E1 ENG FAIL'. The Captain and I ran the QRH and QRC procedures for 'E1 ENG FAIL' and 'inflight engine shutdown' respectively. We made the decision to shutdown the engine and advise ATC. We diverted to ZZZ. We performed the appropriate QRC procedures and made a landing into ZZZ. We taxied the aircraft to the FBO on the Number Two Engine and ran a normal shutdown procedure.Determine if this is a potentially chronic problem fleet wide.", {"entities": [[696, 702, "AVIATION_TERM"], [565, 574, "AIRPLANE"], [492, 500, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1004, 1007, "ABBREVIATION"], [2187, 2190, "ABBREVIATION"], [92, 97, "ALTITUDE"], [1348, 1353, "ALTITUDE"], [214, 217, "ABBREVIATION"], [393, 396, "ABBREVIATION"], [513, 516, "ABBREVIATION"], [1540, 1543, "ABBREVIATION"], [1918, 1921, "ABBREVIATION"], [82, 88, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1331, 1337, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [771, 773, "ABBREVIATION"], [505, 512, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [337, 345, "AIRPLANE"], [219, 222, "ABBREVIATION"], [367, 373, "AIRPLANE"], [417, 423, "AIRPLANE"], [473, 479, "AIRPLANE"], [194, 197, "ABBREVIATION"], [1384, 1387, "ABBREVIATION"], [1473, 1476, "ABBREVIATION"], [1520, 1523, "ABBREVIATION"], [1710, 1713, "ABBREVIATION"], [1761, 1764, "ABBREVIATION"], [1865, 1868, "ABBREVIATION"], [1896, 1903, "CREW"], [150, 153, "AIRPLANE"], [286, 289, "AIRPLANE"], [439, 455, "WEATHER"], [934, 950, "CREW"], [224, 227, "ABBREVIATION"], [1548, 1551, "ABBREVIATION"], [104, 111, "AIRPLANE"], [1397, 1404, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
["I landed without clearance. We landed on Approach Control frequency. While clearing runway I realized we were still on Approach Control frequency. I heard transmissions that sounded like what an Approach Controller would say - not Tower. I asked my partner 'were we cleared to land?' My partner quickly switched to Tower and we heard him clearing us to cross parallel runway and contact Ground. we acknowledged and complied. Tower Controller then said he tried to call us a couple of times. My partner told him that Approach Control never switched us over. The last thing I remember on approach was the Approach Controller issuing us traffic over the stadium; that was it. I do not recall ever being told to contact the Tower. We were also at the end of two very long days dealing with multiple issues and worn down. in this mental state I was not sharp enough to switch to Tower on my own past the marker without being prompted to do so by ATC. It was quiet and smooth. So many approaches and landings in the last four days - it is hard to keep track because they start running together being so automatic. We were fatigued towards the end of this flight. After listening to LIVEATC.com it sounds like we were forgotten about. The Tower asked us where we were parking close to a short final; queried us again; and then again and issued the taxi instructions. Which is when we switched over and heard them. It does not seem as though they were looking for us long. I take full responsibility for landing without a clearance. I always wondered how you could land without a clearance and now I know. Contributing factors were crew fatigue and lack of ATC Comm. Normally I would query ATC about switching to Tower; or just switch myself past the marker if they are busy; but due to fatigue I did not catch it and we continued.

Controller apologized for the confusion and essentially said the mistake was on 'our end.' I played back the recording and discovered that the mistake was indeed mine. We were issued 3;000 ft. not 2;000 ft. The biggest mistake I made was shifting my attention outside the airplane. I could clearly see the airport and the fact we were visually clear of all obstacles.

["Flight XXXX from ZZZ to ZZZ1; returned to field right after departing ZZZ. Shortly after takeoff; the Captain and I noticed high vibration on Engine #2 LP as we climbed through 5;000 - 6;000 feet. Initially; the vibration fluctuated between normal range (green) to amber (caution) range. However; after several seconds; it remained in the caution range. We contacted ATC to level out at 6;000 ft and delay vectors while we ran the QRH checklist. Upon completion of the QRH procedure we kept Engine #2 vibration in normal range. The Captain and I both came upon the decision to return to ZZZ. There were two previous occurrences of engine vibration on Engine # 2 in the AML within the last week. We felt it was prudent to return to ZZZ because we did not want to make any more high power demands; i.e. climb; with the issue at hand. We requested delay vectors to burn off the fuel in order get below max landing weight limitations. ATC vectored us around; and we successfully landed at ZZZ. No emergency was declared. We returned to the field as it [was the] safest decision to do. With two previous documented occurrences of high engine vibration on #2; we did not want to risk another occurrence. By continuing our climb from 6;000 ft to cruising altitude; it puts the engine in a higher power demand with a high probability of another occurrence.\nFlight XXXX returned to ZZZ due to low pressure; high engine vibration on the right hand; Number 2 Engine. Shortly after takeoff; my first officer and I noticed the high vibration as we climbed through 5;000-6;000 feet. The vibration was fluctuating between the green (normal) range and the yellow (caution) range; but was staying more in the caution range than the normal range. The highest we saw for a moment was 4.5 on the LP side of the Number 2 Engine. After leveling off at 6;000 feet; following the QRH procedure and reducing the affected engine's thrust; we were able to maintain the engine in the normal range. However; at that point; the decision made was to return back to the field of ZZZ. We were already in the terminal area and did not want to make anymore high power climbs to altitude with the issue at hand. Considering that this issue had been documented two times in the past few days with a Number 2 Engine high vibration issue; a return to the field was a prudent decision. In the process; we were vectored around in order to get our landing weight below our limitation and had a successful landing on Runway XX in ZZZ. No emergency was declared during this incident.In retrospect; I felt that my first officer and I conducted the situation very professionally; safely and successfully. In all; I made my pilot in command decision to return to field based on the safety of the flight and souls on board my airplane. With a documented history of engine vibrations within the past few days; I do not regret nor question my decision. The engine vibration was abnormally in the caution range and I simply matched my decision based off of that; acting on the side of caution for the safety of my passengers; crew and aircraft. There was no way that I was willing to continue a high power climb to a high altitude with a vibration in the caution range; a documented maintenance history within the past few days and not knowing the potentially hazardous issues that could take place ahead. The only suggestion I could voice is for the thorough inspection of the engine; however; that is being conducted already.", {"entities": [[185, 195, "ALTITUDE"], [1557, 1567, "ALTITUDE"], [1830, 1840, "ALTITUDE"], [387, 395, "ALTITUDE"], [1227, 1235, "ALTITUDE"], [142, 151, "AIRPLANE"], [491, 500, "AIRPLANE"], [89, 96, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1470, 1477, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1239, 1256, "ALTITUDE"], [2677, 2693, "CREW"], [114, 115, "CREW"], [431, 444, "AVIATION_TERM"], [129, 138, "AIRPLANE"], [212, 221, "AIRPLANE"], [501, 510, "AIRPLANE"], [638, 647, "AIRPLANE"], [1137, 1146, "AIRPLANE"], [1410, 1419, "AIRPLANE"], [1519, 1528, "AIRPLANE"], [1573, 1582, "AIRPLANE"], [2283, 2292, "AIRPLANE"], [2474, 2480, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [875, 879, "AIRPLANE"], [102, 109, "CREW"], [532, 539, "CREW"], [367, 370, "CREW"], [931, 934, "CREW"], [903, 917, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2406, 2420, "AVIATION_TERM"]]}]
