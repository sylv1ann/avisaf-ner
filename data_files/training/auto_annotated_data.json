    ["To be clear I did not have a lot going on and my complexity was not high. That is why this was a non-event. However; ORD was super busy on two runways for a little bit and I am sure the Tower was very busy landing 28C departing 28R and 22L. Ground could have also been busy so that is why I put the information in there on complexity and amount of volume. Here is what happened; we were on outboards at ORD. There were a lot of aircraft going over the airport to balance the runways. I had a strip print and an aircraft depart and tag up. It was Aircraft Z. I was waiting for this aircraft to call on. I was waiting and waiting and making a plan. Then the aircraft started climbing out of 5;000 feet; so I reached out and tried to turn the aircraft. He didn't turn or answer. I didn't know what happened or was happening. Then I did it again. I was just about to call back to the Tower and the position next to me was giving a briefing and they turned their aircraft to EARND.Aircraft X. Now they departed off of two different runways but I said to the guy next to me; 'Hey; see if you have Aircraft Z by chance.' He did. So somehow Aircraft Z going westbound departing off of Runway 28R was on the same frequency as Aircraft X departing off of Runway 22L. When the instruction for Aircraft X was given; Aircraft Z and Aircraft X took it. The Controller said he didn't hear any indication that there was a step on each other or anything. During this time Aircraft Y also had departed and went to the incorrect frequency and that Controller had to send him to the correct frequency. So there were 3 similar sounding aircraft on 1 frequency when only two were supposed to be there and they were all climbing when only two were supposed to be. We have tried to explain how bad incorrect frequency transfers could be and have kept records for months but it seems there is no sense of urgency at how bad this could be. The two aircraft came within approximately 4 miles from each other with one climbing blindly. That was very lucky.My recommendations would be to track these incidents when similar sounding aircraft are on the same frequency so that it can be brought to the airline dispatchers' attention and show the replay on what could happen and why they should be aware of the issue. However; when I have brought these things recently to our supervisors in the room; they have been advised that they should not keep track of things like this by [the] upper management Operations managers and higher. They tell us we should report it when they could report it just like I can. This was luck this time that nothing happened. So I guess we will just open that Swiss cheese holes with negligence and laziness and I will be in the seat one day when two planes come together and I may not be lucky like this time to be able to listen to the person next to me give the briefing. Or we can go back to due diligence; attentiveness; and caring and report things like this and care about the operation. Put effort on everyone's end to know when similar call signs are on frequencies or multiple frequencies. Demand that Dispatch works hard to not use call signs like this. Or not; who cares any more right.", {"entities": [[143, 150, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [186, 191, "CREW"], [206, 213, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [218, 227, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [241, 247, "CREW"], [475, 482, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [520, 526, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [673, 681, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [689, 699, "ALTITUDE"], [880, 885, "CREW"], [997, 1005, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1027, 1034, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1160, 1169, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1228, 1237, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1343, 1353, "CREW"], [1475, 1483, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1529, 1539, "CREW"], [1697, 1705, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1990, 1998, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2728, 2732, "AIRPLANE"], [3111, 3119, "CREW"]]}],
	["While descending into PIB out of 14;000 ft. MSL; our aircraft was repeatedly illuminated by a green laser pointer approximately 100 times over about 5 minutes. The first illumination was from a distance of around 20-30 miles. The aircraft had a failed flight director and autopilot at the time and extra attention was required by both pilots for flight path management. Both pilots were directly hit by the laser on several occasions causing minor vision spotting. We notified approach of the approximate source location as we went over it. The laser continued hitting the aircraft as we flew by illuminating the entire flight deck. We were able to land at PIB without incident. I still have spots in my eyes approximately 1.5 hours after exposure. This was by far the worst encounter I have had with a laser while flying an aircraft.It seems to me that pointing a laser at an aircraft should be made illegal.

	["I was boarding the aircraft when a my destination airport changed a NOTAM at my destination airport closing the runway until a further time that day; at the time I was in the aircraft boarding my passengers as I had received an IFR clearance to my destination 10 minutes before. While I was departing the area VFR on an IFR clearance I encountered moderate turbulence below 9000 ft. I reported the weather conditions to both ARTCC and [Operations Control]. At 9000 ft. I entered Icing conditions and requested a higher altitude to get out of the ice. I was assigned 11000 ft. and once established in cruise approximately 50NM from billings I was advised by ARTCC that ZZZ my destination airport had just reported both runway closures and to advise of intentions. I contacted [Operations Control] of the situation and suggested a possible diversion to ZZZ1 instead so as to shuttle the passengers to ZZZ and return back REPO. They liked the plan and said they would contact ZZZ1 to gain conditions and see if they could organize passenger transport. I advised my passengers of the situation. I then was contacted by [Operations Control] that the situation was also bad in ZZZ1 and they too intended to close the runway. I then advised ATC a return to ZZZ2. Shortly after this radio communication I encountered Freezing Rain I advised ATC of the weather conditions and [Operations Control] I also requested a decent to get out of icing conditions. Shortly after this I noticed the annunciation panel was black during windshield operation and noticed the ice was not coming off the windshield. I complied with the QRH and [Requested Priority Handling] with ARTCC due to windshield anti-ice failure. I notified [Operations Control] and got into contact with the ZZZ2 station Manager and advised him of the weather conditions in the area at the diversion airport and of the priority situation. After descending several thousand feet the ice did not clear. I requested ATC give me a lower altitude to try and reach above freezing altitude. At approximately 6000 ft. the windshield ice broke off and I continued with a Visual Approach to Runway XX. After I landed and taxied in I spoke with the passengers: [airport rescue and firefighting]; [Operations Control]; Dispatch; [Maintenance Control]; Station Manager and Station Supervisor about the situation.

	["Aircraft X was approximately 5 Miles NW of the field when Approach Control approval-requested a right downwind entry for Runway 25; capped 2;000 and above for other VFR arrival aircraft for Runway 15L. I approved the request; as soon as traffic permitted I allowed Aircraft X his VFR descent at pilot discretion when he was approximately 2 Miles NNE of the field. Aircraft Y was 5 Miles south of the field; eastbound; on the visual approach for Runway 25. I immediately recognized the conflict. I instructed Aircraft X to turn Base; at this time he was approximately 2.5 Miles NE of the field. I informed Aircraft Y of the glider traffic and instructed him to execute a 5 Mile left base; at this time Aircraft Y was approximately 5 SE of the field. Aircraft Y asked if he needed to extend; I said affirmative; enter a 5 Mile left base. Aircraft Y immediately turned inbound for a 3 Mile left base. Aircraft X was established on a 2 Mile final and at 80 kts. I instructed Aircraft X to go around; he responded unable due to his engine being shut down. I then told Aircraft Y to go around; climb and maintain 3;000; fly heading 255. Aircraft Y read back his instructions and began to climb. I then coordinated with Approach Control; Aircraft Y was on the Standard Missed and coming back to him for re-sequence; Approach Control requested a 200 heading. I issued the 200 heading to Aircraft Y and told him to contact departure. I thought Aircraft Y had started turning and I switched him; but he was not turning. I realized he was heading into a much higher MVA. I told Aircraft Y he needed to start his turn to 200; that he was entering an MVA of 5700 feet but he had already switched frequencies. Adequate initial spacing and sequence provided by approach controller. Compliance from the Aircraft Y pilot to enter a 5 Mile left base. Compliance from Aircraft Y pilot to take assigned headings. Ensuring the pilot is physically turning to assigned heading to avoid conflict prior to frequency change.\nWe took LC (Local Control) for training; I was the trainer. It was in the middle of our training session that approach approved a right down wind arrival for RWY 25. Glider Aircraft X was told to turn a 3mile right base for RWY 25. At that time Aircraft Y was switched to us about 6 miles south of the airport on a visual approach. The trainee told Aircraft Y about glider traffic and instructed Aircraft Y to turn 5 mile left base. The trainee expected Aircraft Y to enter a 5 mile final; however; Aircraft Y turned a 5 mile left base for a 2 mile final and at that time Aircraft X was on a 2 mile going 70 kts. We realized it was not going to work with Aircraft Y going 170 kts so we tried to send Aircraft X around. Aircraft x told us they couldn't go around because their engine was off; so we made the decision to send Aircraft Y around. Initially; Aircraft Y was told to fly northerly hoping to build some space; then they were told to expect to go around. They were given a climb to 030 and a 255 heading; but they never acknowledged and continued northerly. The trainee coordinated the go around with the approach controller; which told us to give Aircraft Y a 200 heading. The trainee gave Aircraft Y that heading and switched them to approach. The aircraft continued northerly into a 5700 feet MVA for another few miles before they started their turn. After reviewing and listening to the tapes; we concluded that there was a misunderstanding between us and Aircraft Y. We gave certain instructions; but didn't get the results we expected. We should have used more control instructions such as; extend your downwind I'll call your base. We also switched Aircraft Y a bit too early; especially since he was heading in a north direction into a 5700 feet MVA.

	["When the crew arrived at [the aircraft]; Maintenance Control had deferred the ground idle portion of the EEC's (Electronic Engine Control). Myself as the Captain looked over the DDG (Dispatch Deviation Guide); talked with the two mechanics on board and found that everything was written off properly. The Mechanic and I discussed the ramifications a little bit on the referral. The plane blocked out on time with a normal engine start and normal taxi to [the] runway. However upon takeoff clearance and bringing the thrust levers up to approximately 70% we noticed the right engine was accelerating quicker than the left engine. It wasn't exceeding any limitations but still as the Captain and because we had the deferral concerning the situation ; I felt it would be better/ conservative to just bring the thrust levers back and taxi off the runway and discuss what was actually going on with the mechanics in a safe environment on the taxiway and that is what I did. I asked the First Officer to cancel takeoff clearance and that we would like to clear the runway and discuss a possible maintenance issue. So we cleared the runway; I spoke to the mechanics about the situation and it is quite common on most of the 767 200s for the right engine to accelerate quicker than the left engine. I don't know why this is but I've noticed it on many different airplanes. So we cleared the runway.I spoke to the mechanics about the situation. I remembered talking to Maintenance Control the day before and he informed me there are no time limits for the engines to accelerate together. At this moment on the taxiway I confirm that with the two mechanics that only the two engines had to match and then accelerate uniformly after takeoff thrust button was pushed and takeoff power is set. After clearing the runway there were no checklists to be run since there are no EICAS messages or abnormal events. I just wanted to understand that everything was fairly normal. The break chart was not needed to be consulted since we never really release the brakes for takeoff. Takeoff power was never set. By definition in the FOM a rejected takeoff was never really performed since take off power was never set however I am going to treat this like a rejected takeoff just in case. The two mechanics and the First Officer and myself discussed that we would perform the takeoff again.... let the engines both stabilize at approximately 70% and then push the takeoff thrust button and if the engines accelerated absolutely perfectly symmetrically to takeoff thrust then we would continue the takeoff. This is exactly what happened on the second takeoff and this is normally what happens on most of the 767 200s. The engines do not accelerate to 70% symmetrically all the time but they do accelerate from 70%to takeoff thrust symmetrically. Maintenance Control and the mechanics confirmed there is no time limit to where these engines have to accelerate to the 70% setting. The takeoff was normal.", {"entities": [[14, 21, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [41, 52, "CREW"], [154, 161, "CREW"], [183, 191, "CREW"], [305, 313, "CREW"], [422, 428, "AIRPLANE"], [460, 466, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [481, 488, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [575, 581, "AIRPLANE"], [621, 627, "AIRPLANE"], [682, 689, "CREW"], [830, 834, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [843, 849, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [937, 944, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [981, 994, "CREW"], [1005, 1012, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1059, 1065, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1089, 1100, "CREW"], [1126, 1132, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1240, 1246, "AIRPLANE"], [1283, 1289, "AIRPLANE"], [1383, 1389, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1460, 1471, "CREW"], [1601, 1608, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1722, 1729, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1759, 1766, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1800, 1806, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1861, 1866, "AIRPLANE"], [2051, 2058, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2060, 2067, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2116, 2132, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2166, 2174, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2235, 2251, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2292, 2305, "CREW"], [2353, 2360, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2441, 2448, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2532, 2539, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2574, 2581, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2627, 2634, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2792, 2799, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2822, 2833, "CREW"], [2959, 2966, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["During descent into ZZZ on the RNAV arrival; I was the PF (Pilot Flying) and the CA (Captain) was the PM (Pilot Monitoring). ATC told us to expect Runway XXL and cleared us to point ZZZZZ on the ILS XXL approach. This clearance put the aircraft on an intercept to final from the north side of the approach course. At approximately 10-15 nm from ZZZZZ and in IMC; ATC cleared us to descend from 6;500 ft to 5;300 ft MSL. I descended and the aircraft leveled off at 5;300 ft. Shortly thereafter; and still in IMC; we received an aural EGPWS Caution (\"CAUTION TERRAIN\") followed immediately by an aural EGPWS Warning (\"TERRAIN; TERRAIN PULL UP\"). I immediately selected TOGA thrust and full back sidestick. Both the CA and I had TERR ON ND selected on our respective instrument panels. I did not observe any solid red or yellow areas on my ND; nor did I observe TERR or OBST AHEAD. The EGPWS Caution and Warning each sounded only the one time; and neither was heard again after initiating the maneuver. While subsequently initiating a level-off; I left TOGA thrust selected too long and allowed airspeed to reach approximately 280 KIAS. The aircraft was clean; so no configuration limits were exceeded; however I still exceeded the 250-KIAS limit below 10;000 MSL. The CA called out my excessive airspeed and I subsequently reduced thrust. The CA had already notified ATC that we were maneuvering in response to the EGPWS Warning. During the process; and while leveling at 6;000 ft. MSL (MSA for the approach); we regained VMC and subsequently coordinated vectors for a visual approach to Runway XXL. A normal approach and landing ensued. Following the EGPWS warning and escape maneuver; ATC advised the CA that the minimum vectoring altitude in our area at the time was 3;800 ft MSL. Based on the fact that we were level at the ATC-assigned altitude of 5;300 ft; above the minimum vectoring altitude; and did not observe any of the expected indications on the CA or FO NDs; I believe this was a false EGPWS warning. That said; in the process of responding to an EGPWS Warning; I allowed airspeed to drop out of my scan with TOGA thrust selected and consequently exceeded 250 KIAS below 10;000 ft MSL.Following the EGPWS warning and escape maneuver; ATC advised the CA that the minimum vectoring altitude in our area at the time was 3;800 feet MSL.

That said; in the process of responding to an EGPWS Warning; I allowed airspeed to drop out of my scan with TOGA thrust selected and consequently exceeded 250 KIAS below 10'000 ft MSL.\nWe started our briefing before our descent into ZZZ...we went over the threats...which included a discussion about mountainous terrain; discussion about the engine out missed approach procedures; and displaying the terrain on our ND.The approach briefing included a briefing on the Minimum Safe Altitudes. Near the end of the STAR; we were initially given direct ZZZZZ; the FAF for XXL. Then we were given vectors to Runway XXL. We were given various step down altitudes by ATC. I don't remember all of them but we were given 6;500 ft. and then a descent to 5;300 ft.We were in Open Descent. We slowed ourselves for the descent and approach to approx. 220 KIAS. We were in a clean configuration. We were well ahead of the aircraft. Somewhere above 5;300 we entered IMC...full overcast layer. We had just leveled at 5;300 ft. when we got a single 'Caution Terrain'.I quickly checked the altimeter and we were level at 5;300 and all flight instruments showed normal for level flight. Almost as quickly we got a single 'Terrain Pull Up' We executed the EGPWS recovery maneuver. We set TOGA thrust and pitched up and started climbing. I notified ATC. During the procedure; ATC stated that the minimum altitude she could descend us to was 3;800 ft.??; I was too busy to remember.Immediately the EGPWS warning stopped (we only got one of each warning). Neither ND showed terrain or warning. All we got were the single two aural warnings. There were no other visual indications. We leveled at approximately 6;000. The EGPWS did not activate any more.We briefly exited out of the clouds around 6;000 and I could visually see ahead. Satisfied that we were clear of terrain I noticed that we had accelerated past 250KIAS...this was because of the recovery maneuver; the TOGA thrust setting; and leveling at 6;000. My focus was directed at climbing and altitude. Once we recognized our airspeed; we corrected our airspeed. Again we were in the clean configuration so no aircraft limitation was exceeded.During the re-vector back to ZZZ; I checked our altimeters with the ATIS; and they were set correctly. Once I was satisfied we were clear of terrain; ATC vectored us back for a visual approach to XXL and landed normally.

	["During preflight planning discovered this was the third airplane assigned to the flight. Arrived at the aircraft and discussed two MEL (Minimum Equipment List) items which we reviewed together and called Maintenance out to clarify an item. All four pilots handled and reviewed the logbook during this discussion. We all briefed the ETOPS (Extended Twin Operations) signoff and agreed it was done and in the book. The boarding was slightly delayed so there was no pressure to get things done quickly. After about two hours into cruise Dispatch sent a message asking if the ETOPS signoff was in the logbook. I checked it and found that there was indeed an entry and it was the correct date but saw that the departure station was ZZZZ. This means that the signoff was for the previous leg which was the day before. The day before; in the other hemisphere. We all were looking for an ETOPS date and we all saw what we expected to see. At that point we were not in ETOPS airspace and worked out a routing with Dispatch that avoided ETOPS airspace entirely and secured the clearances with ATC (Air Traffic Control). Shortly after Dispatch told us that the maintenance department wanted us to return the airplane to ZZZ. We asked to divert to minimize the delay to the passengers but were told to return to ZZZ. The return to ZZZ required and overweight landing at 485;000 lbs (max landing weight is 460;000 lbs); so ATC was advised. All checklists were complete and an uneventful landing was made.I think all pilots expected to see an ETOPS signoff dated [the same day] and that is exactly what we saw. We should have reviewed the entry more carefully. There was no reason as we were not rushing to depart; we just missed the fact that the last leg originated in the other hemisphere.I need to inspect the logbook entries more carefully and make sure I know where the previous leg originated; especially when a change of equipment is involved.

	["Aircraft X was inbound to the airport from the southeast. Apparently the aircraft was on an IFR flight plan and I completely overlooked that information. It took the aircraft traveling about 10 miles inside my airspace before the pilot called and made first contact with me. When the pilot finally called me and told me he had the current ATIS I had asked the pilot which route he wanted to take inbound to North Las Vegas airport. Again; I failed to look at all the information in the data block and treated him as if he was VFR. When I asked the pilot which route he wanted and he was open to either route; I gave the aircraft a clearance through the Class Bravo airspace and assigned a heading of 270 with no altitude assigned. A minute or so later I asked the pilot if he was familiar with the local flying area and the surrounding terrain; and after he replied in the affirmative; I instructed the pilot to resume own navigation then fly heading 360.After I got that read back; I instructed the pilot to cross the airport at and maintain 5;000 feet. A few minutes later as he approached the airport from the southeast and was approximately 6 miles to the southeast and over a 6;300 Minimum Vectoring Altitude. I had noticed there were numerous VFR departures departing southbound; so I assigned a heading of 320 to stay away from the targets I saw departing. At this time the pilot had already begun his descent to comply with the VFR instructions that I had issued; and never mentioned that he was IFR. As stated before I didn't realize he was IFR. I had made a couple traffic calls regarding the departing aircraft who were not Radar identified; and at that time a Controller a few positions over mentioned the altitude of Aircraft X and that was the first time I noticed the data block and all the information that I initially missed indicating that he was in fact IFR. At that point The aircraft was already at 5;500 feet heading northwest bound; and it was at this point that I and the Supervisor talked about the aircraft and the situation at hand.I don't know that there are any recommendations or changes that can or should be made to prevent this from happening again in the future. I simply missed the information in the data block indicating that this aircraft was IFR. When I issued a Class Bravo clearance and all appropriate navigation and altitude instructions for a VFR aircraft; I had the expectation bias that the aircraft was indeed VFR when he accepted all the instructions and never questioned the clearance. I missed the indicators that he was on an IFR flight plan and there is nothing more to it and completely my fault and no one else's.", {"entities": [[92, 95, "ABBREVIATION"], [230, 235, "CREW"], [284, 289, "CREW"], [339, 343, "ABBREVIATION"], [360, 365, "CREW"], [526, 529, "ABBREVIATION"], [548, 553, "CREW"], [764, 769, "CREW"], [804, 810, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [903, 908, "CREW"], [939, 942, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1000, 1005, "CREW"], [1043, 1053, "ALTITUDE"], [1081, 1091, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1249, 1252, "ABBREVIATION"], [1264, 1273, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1353, 1362, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1381, 1386, "CREW"], [1409, 1416, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1436, 1439, "ABBREVIATION"], [1504, 1507, "ABBREVIATION"], [1550, 1553, "ABBREVIATION"], [1603, 1612, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1672, 1682, "CREW"], [1873, 1876, "ABBREVIATION"], [1920, 1930, "ALTITUDE"], [2281, 2284, "ABBREVIATION"], [2387, 2390, "ABBREVIATION"], [2457, 2460, "ABBREVIATION"], [2577, 2580, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],
	["ZDC was inundated with moderate to severe turbulence associated with a cold front.  We received GI messages for severe turbulence in ZDC Areas 6 and 5 (XA05Z FL180-190 at MOL; XA25Z 140-FL210 at CSN; XA43Z FL210 at LDN; XA51Z 170 at MRB); which we assumed would mean that the front that was traveling northeast bound; toward us; would eventually provide Area 1 with the same conditions. The controllers at sector 17 and 12 coordinated directly with the sectors behind them to re-route PHL aircraft over SWL for the JIIMS arrival instead of BUKYY; and we then asked our supervisor to advise TMU of this coordination. As the part of the front approached BUKYY that had been getting severe reports; our supervisor asked if we could take a pathfinder through the front because Area 4 was being inundated with PHL arrivals that they were not originally projected to get.  I was training a D-side at sectors 18/19 starting around XC00Z; where we work arrivals to TEB (JAIKE); EWR (PHLBO); and LGA (KORRY). We were supposed to be complying with a 15MIT restriction to EWR and a 20MIT restriction for JAIKE. Our R-side was receiving 20MIT from the sector behind us for EWR and 25MIT for JAIKE; which is our standard feed. Due to the winds; our R-side was vectoring to attempt to give the next sectors those mileages; but was unable to do so. Our EWR arrivals were unable to comply with the 'descend via' restrictions; and also needed to be vectored not only for the MIT but in order to get the arrivals low enough into the next sector at all. My D-side trainee was doing point-outs for the vectored aircraft; and we asked our Supervisor to put in reports for moderate turbulence; which all aircraft were getting between 170-FL250. We also advised our Supervisor three times that he needed to coordinate with Area 2 to provide at least 35MIT for our area on JAIKE arrivals and 25MIT for EWR arrivals. This was only communicated on the fourth attempt; when our R-side stood up and shouted at the Area 2 supervisor that 'We NEED 35MIT for JAIKE arrivals!!!' The Area 2 supervisor reported not having heard anything about this requested restriction. Eventually in the night; I did work the R-side at sector 12; and I was personally providing 30-35MIT at FL250 and 250 kts for all EWR arrivals; and sector 18/19 was barely capable of keeping 15MIT even with an added 20MIT restriction. Around XD00Z; our D-side training was suspended and I was assigned to relieve the Controller at sectors 17/11. The Controller I relieved advised me he had shut off COLIN departures southbound and J42 departures northbound due to moderate to severe turbulence. Within 10 minutes of sitting at the sector; I had aircraft departing on both of those routes. Once the aircraft departed the airports; the only way to get them out of the turbulence was to get them above FL250; and I was not going to make PCT KRANT hold aircraft in known severe turbulence. I called KRANT to advise that we would accept no more aircraft due to continuous moderate to severe turbulence. I was relieved from that sector by XD15Z; where the relieving Controller ended up having a priority handling situation due to severe turbulence and at least three more reports northbound. Within 10 minutes of our D-side training being terminated; the Controller at sectors 18/19 requested a D-side again; as JAIKE arrivals started to report severe turbulence. The Controller had the sector behind hold JAIKE arrivals due to severe turbulence. 1. 'As the part of the front approached BUKYY that had been getting severe reports; our supervisor asked if we could take a pathfinder through the front because Area 4 was being inundated with PHL arrivals that they were not originally projected to get.' Our TMU should have put restrictions out for other traffic entering sector 54 to avoid this being an issue; or routed PHL traffic earlier to have a more cohesive flow BEFORE they h ad to be sequenced in sector 54. The answer should NOT have been attempting to put any aircraft through known areas of moderate to severe turbulence. 2. 'We received GI messages for severe turbulence in ZDC Areas 6 and 5 (XA05Z FL180-190 at MOL; XA25Z 140-FL210 at CSN; XA43Z FL210 at LDN; XA51Z 170 at MRB); which we assumed would mean that the front that was traveling northeast bound; toward us; would eventually provide Area 1 with the same conditions.' In Area 1; we did not have severe turbulence begin until the XC00Z hour. There should have been restrictions in play to route aircraft away from the turbulence as soon as the ZDC powers-that-be realized that this was going to continue as the front traveled eastbound. 3. 'The Controller I relieved advised me he had shut off COLIN departures southbound and J42 departures northbound due to moderate to severe turbulence. Within 10 minutes of sitting at the sector; I had aircraft departing on both of those routes.' I have no idea why this happened. This was communicated both through our supervisor; presumably then through TMU; and PCT KRANT sector. NO departures should have come out beyond that point. 4. 'Within 10 minutes of our D-side training being terminated; the Controller at sectors 18/19 requested a D-side again; as JAIKE arrivals started to report severe turbulence.' Either (A) we should have never been removed from the sector; or (B) a D-side should have been paged back before I was assigned to relieve the Controller at sectors 17/11. 5. 'The Controller had the sector behind hold JAIKE arrivals due to severe turbulence.' This should have happened earlier; or aircraft should have been re-routed onto a route that did not have known severe turbulence. We knew hours in advance that there was potential for this. Eventually the JAIKE arrivals were routed up J220 through ZNY; but this should have happened much earlier.", {"entities": [[42, 52, "WEATHER"], [71, 81, "WEATHER"], [119, 129, "WEATHER"], [276, 281, "WEATHER"], [635, 640, "WEATHER"], [759, 764, "WEATHER"], [1660, 1670, "WEATHER"], [2621, 2631, "WEATHER"], [2804, 2814, "WEATHER"], [2912, 2922, "WEATHER"], [3024, 3034, "WEATHER"], [3169, 3179, "WEATHER"], [3384, 3394, "WEATHER"], [3467, 3477, "WEATHER"], [3502, 3507, "WEATHER"], [3626, 3631, "WEATHER"], [4053, 4063, "WEATHER"], [4104, 4114, "WEATHER"], [4261, 4266, "WEATHER"], [4407, 4417, "WEATHER"], [4522, 4532, "WEATHER"], [4615, 4620, "WEATHER"], [4782, 4792, "WEATHER"], [5243, 5253, "WEATHER"], [5503, 5513, "WEATHER"], [5634, 5644, "WEATHER"], [158, 163, "ALTITUDE"], [182, 191, "ALTITUDE"], [206, 211, "ALTITUDE"], [641, 651, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1712, 1721, "ALTITUDE"], [2242, 2247, "ALTITUDE"], [2256, 2259, "ABBREVIATION"], [2455, 2465, "CREW"], [2488, 2498, "CREW"], [2692, 2701, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2745, 2753, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2837, 2842, "ALTITUDE"], [3098, 3108, "CREW"], [3287, 3297, "CREW"], [3400, 3410, "CREW"], [3508, 3518, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4143, 4148, "ALTITUDE"], [4167, 4176, "ALTITUDE"], [4191, 4196, "ALTITUDE"], [4649, 4659, "CREW"], [4853, 4862, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5146, 5156, "CREW"], [5399, 5409, "CREW"], [5436, 5446, "CREW"]]}],
	["I was working local control in a south operation. I had Aircraft Y holding in position on RWY19 with Aircraft X on final for RWY19. There was a small layer of clouds in between the buildings in Rosslyn and the Kennedy Center (our 2 mile final visual landmark). This small area of clouds did not prevent the aircraft from seeing the runway; and none of the previous aircraft on final disappeared from my view. During this operation; shortly after putting Aircraft Y in position; Aircraft X disappeared into the cloud just as they were passing the buildings over Rosslyn. I cleared Aircraft Y knowing that Aircraft X was somewhere between a two and three mile final. I could not tell exactly where Aircraft X was because they were behind a cloud that blocked my sight; but they were still showing outside of two miles on the radar. When I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff; I said 'traffic is inside of a three mile final'. Shortly after takeoff roll; Aircraft X came out of the clouds and I saw they were inside of a two mile final. At that point I knew this may be an operation that I may not have runway separation minimums. I asked Aircraft X to square his last turn if able; to try to achieve the 6;000 ft and airborne. A few seconds after that I could tell this would not work and issued go-around instructions to Aircraft X on what I would estimate to be just inside of a half mile final. His instructions were to turn right to a heading of 250 and maintain 3;000 ft. He read back correctly; but did not turn and flew over top the runway while climbing. I then issued an instruction to turn right to a 270 heading to ensure separation from Aircraft Y departing.  Even after this; I observed Aircraft X continuing on runway heading. I then issued traffic and told him to turn immediately. After this; he finally started to turn. I would estimate that Aircraft X flew at least 2 miles after I issued the initial go-around heading before they started their turn.  I recommend that I could have issued a traffic alert and said to turn immediately earlier than I did. I also think that I could have held on to the departing aircraft longer and turned them eastbound to ensure diverging headings from the trailing go-around aircraft that was issued a westbound turn. In my experience; it is not the norm in a go-around for an aircraft to fly for so long after being issued a turn; to not turn. I am not a pilot myself; so I'm not sure what is considered a reasonable amount of time to 'clean up' the airplane while going around. Again; I from what I've experienced; this is not the norm.

	["Ceilings were sufficient for CAT I approach; but very close to minimums. On final; Approach and Tower issued wake turbulence advisory for heavy Airbus in front of us [6-7 miles) per TCAS. As First Officer Pilot Flying approach was stable (autopilot engaged). Approach light system was acquired just above minimums; and then runway/markings/lighting was acquired prior to 100 feet per FOM. I stated 'Continue' instead of 'landing' due to lights vs runway contrary to the FOM; creating a challenge from PM (CA) to confirm my intentions. Past the threshold (below 50 feet); the aircraft began to roll and was pushed slightly left of centerline due to wake turbulence. I rolled the aircraft back and attempted to correct back to centerline. I accepted a landing slightly left of centerline and the landing rollout was uneventful. After landing; ACARS data reflected a 5.0 degree bank on landing (maximum 7.5). In hindsight; a go-around would have been a better choice.\nWe were cautioned following heavy on ILS 8L. We saw we were 5 miles in trail. Per FOM since it was First Officer's leg we briefed the ILS CAT1 approach and back up CAT3. When we left [departure airport]; forecast was well above CAT 1. RVR was 2;000; so we briefed that just prior to FAF get final RVR and if need be switch to CAT 3 change mins from CAT 1 barometric to CAT 3 radio alt mins and Captain take control. Second auto pilot was turned on when approach clearance given.At about 50 feet; I observed the nose come up slightly and I thought First Officer was starting flare early although very small up nose. Then at about 30 feet; we got a roll input which the First Officer countered and we rolled in opposite direction and drifted well left of center line. As I was about to call go around; the First Officer stabilized the situation and we landed left of centerline. It was by no means a hard landing in vertical drop and roll was stable. However much to my surprise when we checked post report on roll it showed 5 degrees with wingtip contact at 7.5. I would never thought it was that close to wing contact.Post shut down debrief reveal the first error on my part was engaging second autopilot when a First Officer non autoland was planned. Looking up in FM second autopilot can be turned on NLT 800 feet. This should have been delayed until decision to change to CAT if needed prior to FAF. This caused aircraft to trim nose up and it was that nose up trim the First Officer was fighting when he turned autopilot off. Second now that I have a better 'picture' of what excessive roll looks like a go-around should have been called.I can say though had RVR dropped and it was an autoland the first rolling movement would definitely command a go-around as an auto and would not have been successful.", {"entities": [[109, 124, "WEATHER"], [154, 159, "WEATHER"], [648, 663, "WEATHER"], [35, 43, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [83, 91, "CREW"], [96, 101, "CREW"], [182, 186, "ABBREVIATION"], [191, 204, "CREW"], [218, 226, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [239, 248, "AIRPLANE"], [259, 267, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [324, 330, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [331, 339, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [371, 379, "ALTITUDE"], [447, 453, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [505, 507, "ABBREVIATION"], [544, 553, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [561, 568, "ALTITUDE"], [630, 640, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [725, 735, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [775, 785, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [841, 846, "AIRPLANE"], [922, 931, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1002, 1005, "ABBREVIATION"], [1064, 1077, "CREW"], [1099, 1102, "ABBREVIATION"], [1108, 1116, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1200, 1203, "ABBREVIATION"], [1262, 1265, "ABBREVIATION"], [1340, 1345, "AIRPLANE"], [1359, 1366, "CREW"], [1393, 1398, "CREW"], [1418, 1426, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1452, 1459, "ALTITUDE"], [1476, 1480, "AIRPLANE"], [1512, 1525, "CREW"], [1574, 1578, "AIRPLANE"], [1594, 1601, "ALTITUDE"], [1633, 1646, "CREW"], [1754, 1763, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1769, 1782, "CREW"], [1815, 1821, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1830, 1840, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2070, 2074, "AIRPLANE"], [2160, 2169, "AIRPLANE"], [2177, 2190, "CREW"], [2241, 2250, "AIRPLANE"], [2272, 2280, "ALTITUDE"], [2397, 2401, "AIRPLANE"], [2421, 2425, "AIRPLANE"], [2438, 2451, "CREW"], [2480, 2489, "AIRPLANE"], [2573, 2582, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2628, 2631, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],
	["This report is largely informational. To the best of my knowledge no flight deck crew member did anything wrong; nor was there any malfunction.  While reviewing the paperwork for this flight I noticed the maintenance release form listed a previous leg's multi bird strike which was fully signed off by Maintenance. The corrective action by Maintenance mentioned that bird parts/feathers may have been ingested into the engine. I mentally noted this; and watched the engine closely during start; taxi; and power-up for takeoff. The entire time the engine and all aircraft systems were entirely and completely normal. In the middle of the takeoff roll (above 100 knots) myself and the First Officer both noticed a strange smell but since absolutely everything was functioning normally we continued. One of the flight attendants called the flight deck at around 500 feet; in the climb saying they smelled something and they were concerned. We assured them we were safe and we would call them back shortly. By 1;000 feet in the climb the smell dissipated and went away completely; all systems were normal; the engines were purring contentedly; and we had no indication of anything wrong at all. Although I was ready to turn back to ZZZ immediately there was no reason to; since there was nothing wrong. We continued the climb; and at a reasonable altitude I called the flight attendants back and explained that everything was absolutely fine; we were going to continue to ZZZ1; and I suspected the strange smell was burning bird feathers from the bird strike. They accepted this and we continued to ZZZ1 without incident. At the gate before deplaning I asked the flight attendants (as I do every leg) if they needed anything further from me. They said no; so I proceeded to the next gate for my next flight.  Just before pushing off the gate for the next leg; Operations and Maintenance called me asking for an explanation for the earlier smells which the previous flight attendants had apparently communicated to them. Maintenance asked me to fill out a 2-page questionnaire which I completed and handed back to them before my next departure. None of the questions on their forms were relevant but I answered them to the best of my ability anyway; then provided a written statement on the back to explain what happened. They seemed satisfied with this and we went our separate ways.  In summary; with the information we had in front of us; we had no reason to believe there was anything wrong with that aircraft at any time from the time we left the gate in ZZZ to the point of setting the brakes at the gate in ZZZ1. With the information we had there was no reason to abort the takeoff; and there was no reason to air-return. The First Officer and I were in complete agreement on this; the cabin crew was kept informed; and safety was never in question. It is not uncommon to smell strange things for brief periods of time on our flights in general; and we assess things and make appropriate decisions. It is possible that there was something else wrong with the airplane and that the information provided about the bird strike led me to a false conclusion; in which case a maintenance write-up may have proven useful. I did not write it up because to the best of my knowledge; given the information provided to me both through the maintenance log and all physical evidence in front of me; there was never actually anything wrong.  As an aside; I am curious about how or why the flight attendants communicated this to maintenance without communicating with me first. Their concerns and input are always valid; however I did not think this was our procedure.", {"entities": [[2424, 2429, "WEATHER"], [3375, 3380, "WEATHER"], [205, 216, "CREW"], [302, 313, "CREW"], [340, 351, "CREW"], [419, 425, "AIRPLANE"], [466, 472, "AIRPLANE"], [518, 525, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [547, 553, "AIRPLANE"], [637, 644, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [683, 696, "CREW"], [808, 825, "CREW"], [859, 867, "ALTITUDE"], [876, 881, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1006, 1016, "ALTITUDE"], [1024, 1029, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1316, 1321, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1365, 1382, "CREW"], [1625, 1629, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1659, 1676, "CREW"], [1779, 1783, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1833, 1837, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1871, 1882, "CREW"], [1961, 1978, "CREW"], [2016, 2027, "CREW"], [2547, 2551, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2601, 2605, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2676, 2683, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2728, 2741, "CREW"], [2788, 2798, "CREW"], [3172, 3183, "CREW"], [3330, 3341, "CREW"], [3477, 3494, "CREW"], [3516, 3527, "CREW"]]}],

We had already briefed the CAT II ILS into Dayton.Once the WING ANTI ICE was selected off per the QRH my priority became step 2; 'Leave icing conditions.' It was not possible to do this via exiting the cold cloud; either up or down. We were at 280 kts. and descending. I could not remember the SAT to TAT equation off the top of my head (a check of Google says TAT = SAT + (TAS/100)^2); but I did recall the main point; that it was in proportion to the square of the speed. Therefore; a small change in TAS would result in a large swing in TAT; allowing us to directly control the TAT as limited by the SAT and the speed envelope of the airplane. (Per the equation; 300 kts. = a nine-degree increase; 400 = 16; 450 = 20.25; etc. There is little change at speeds below M 0.2).I immediately called for the FO (First Officer) to increase speed to 320 kts. in order to increase the TAT. (I had no time to explain why until later. He complied immediately; though. Nice work). We were out of icing conditions forthwith. And so we remained; but had to exceed 250 kts. below 10000 ft. in order to do so. This required [us to advise ATC]. As we got lower we were able to maintain adequate TAT at normal speeds; and so cancelled the [event] before landing.I wanted to have a viable plan in case I was unable to stay out of ice on the approach. We got weather for the alternate from ATC. It was no good for our purpose. I asked Dispatch for the best/closest ice-free airport in my fuel range; and concurred with his recommendation of ZZZ. We informed ATC of that contingency. I was prepared to continue with my desired speed and altitude per emergency authority if necessary. ATC was very helpful; and I'm sure we could have worked it out quickly.We did not run TEST items with the flight attendants. I was pretty sure the issue would be gone before landing; it did not involve the cabin; and I was way more interested in their normal procedures for the CAT II at that point. I did make the regular CAT II announcement on schedule.ATC reported negative ice from aircraft in front of us on the approach. We flew cowls/no wings with a TAT of seven to nine-ish on final. It was above 10 below about 500 ft. I flew the CAT II; of course. We broke out just below CAT I mins and landed normally.[Maintenance] showed that both loops detected a leak along the right side of the fuselage.", {"entities": [[217, 222, "WEATHER"], [401, 406, "WEATHER"], [1251, 1256, "WEATHER"], [1606, 1613, "WEATHER"], [2328, 2333, "WEATHER"], [53, 60, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [143, 146, "ABBREVIATION"], [205, 208, "ABBREVIATION"], [299, 302, "ABBREVIATION"], [363, 366, "ABBREVIATION"], [513, 516, "ABBREVIATION"], [522, 532, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [768, 771, "ABBREVIATION"], [935, 938, "ABBREVIATION"], [1069, 1071, "ABBREVIATION"], [1073, 1086, "CREW"], [1113, 1116, "ABBREVIATION"], [1321, 1324, "ABBREVIATION"], [1332, 1340, "ALTITUDE"], [1389, 1392, "CREW"], [1589, 1597, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1637, 1640, "CREW"], [1682, 1690, "CREW"], [1805, 1808, "CREW"], [1930, 1933, "CREW"], [2036, 2053, "CREW"], [2136, 2141, "AIRPLANE"], [2285, 2288, "CREW"], [2347, 2355, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2360, 2364, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2450, 2456, "ALTITUDE"], [2460, 2464, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2527, 2533, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2624, 2632, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["During climbout with Houston departure we were given a phone number to call for 'possible pilot deviation.' After landing; Captain spoke with a Controller from Houston Center that informed him that we initially checked in at 2;200 feet climbing to 16;000 feet (the final altitude on the SID) when the initial altitude for the departure was supposed to be 5;000 feet. At that point we re-examined the chart and failed to find the 5;000 feet initial climb limitation; after being put on hold we then informed that the information was contained in the PDC strip. We then located the PDC printout and confirmed that we were cleared on the departure and it said the 'maintain 5;000 feet.' The altitude restriction was not crossed because we received a clearance to climb to 16;000 feet upon checking in at 2;200 feet. ATC also informed us that this is a somewhat common occurrence on this departure.Unfamiliarity with the airport and departure (first time at HOU) caused more time to be spent analyzing the taxi chart and SID chart to ensure compliance with taxi instructions as well as the listed initial climb inset and top altitude. The Tower Controller gave us a heading of 350 on the takeoff clearance but did not mention an altitude.Since according to ATC this is a somewhat common occurrence an additional mention by Tower of any climb restriction or heading not listed on the SID would help air crews ensure compliance during the climbout.

Training and instincts took over. Having a professional and highly competent crew member assisting me made a huge difference during this event. SIC was outstanding!\nWhile in cruise flight at FL350; I was alerted to an advisory CAS message 'HYD SYS FAULT'. A few seconds after that fault I was alerted to an advisory CAS message 'NO ENG DISPATCH'. I looked up the CAS messages in the QRH and POH. I read that they were 'crew awareness' messages only and they were related to certain aircraft systems. There were no procedures to perform related to these CAS messages. Within a few minutes of the advisory CAS message I felt; and heard the Number One Engine power reduce and I was then alerted to a cautionary CAS message 'E1 ENG FAIL'. The Captain and I ran the QRH and QRC procedures for 'E1 ENG FAIL' and 'inflight engine shutdown' respectively. We made the decision to shutdown the engine and advise ATC. We diverted to ZZZ.

	["I landed without clearance. We landed on Approach Control frequency. While clearing runway I realized we were still on Approach Control frequency. I heard transmissions that sounded like what an Approach Controller would say - not Tower. I asked my partner 'were we cleared to land?' My partner quickly switched to Tower and we heard him clearing us to cross parallel runway and contact Ground. we acknowledged and complied. Tower Controller then said he tried to call us a couple of times. My partner told him that Approach Control never switched us over. The last thing I remember on approach was the Approach Controller issuing us traffic over the stadium; that was it. I do not recall ever being told to contact the Tower. We were also at the end of two very long days dealing with multiple issues and worn down. in this mental state I was not sharp enough to switch to Tower on my own past the marker without being prompted to do so by ATC. It was quiet and smooth. So many approaches and landings in the last four days - it is hard to keep track because they start running together being so automatic. We were fatigued towards the end of this flight. After listening to LIVEATC.com it sounds like we were forgotten about. The Tower asked us where we were parking close to a short final; queried us again; and then again and issued the taxi instructions. Which is when we switched over and heard them. It does not seem as though they were looking for us long. I take full responsibility for landing without a clearance. I always wondered how you could land without a clearance and now I know. Contributing factors were crew fatigue and lack of ATC Comm.

	["Flight XXXX from ZZZ to ZZZ1; returned to field right after departing ZZZ. Shortly after takeoff; the Captain and I noticed high vibration on Engine #2 LP as we climbed through 5;000 - 6;000 feet. Initially; the vibration fluctuated between normal range (green) to amber (caution) range. However; after several seconds; it remained in the caution range. We contacted ATC to level out at 6;000 ft and delay vectors while we ran the QRH checklist. Upon completion of the QRH procedure we kept Engine #2 vibration in normal range. The Captain and I both came upon the decision to return to ZZZ. There were two previous occurrences of engine vibration on Engine # 2 in the AML within the last week. We felt it was prudent to return to ZZZ because we did not want to make any more high power demands; i.e. climb; with the issue at hand. We requested delay vectors to burn off the fuel in order get below max landing weight limitations. ATC vectored us around; and we successfully landed at ZZZ. No emergency was declared. We returned to the field as it [was the] safest decision to do. With two previous documented occurrences of high engine vibration on #2; we did not want to risk another occurrence. By continuing our climb from 6;000 ft to cruising altitude; it puts the engine in a higher power demand with a high probability of another occurrence.\nFlight XXXX returned to ZZZ due to low pressure; high engine vibration on the right hand; Number 2 Engine. Shortly after takeoff; my first officer and I noticed the high vibration as we climbed through 5;000-6;000 feet. The vibration was fluctuating between the green (normal) range and the yellow (caution) range; but was staying more in the caution range than the normal range. The highest we saw for a moment was 4.5 on the LP side of the Number 2 Engine. After leveling off at 6;000 feet; following the QRH procedure and reducing the affected engine's thrust; we were able to maintain the engine in the normal range. However; at that point; the decision made was to return back to the field of ZZZ. We were already in the terminal area and did not want to make anymore high power climbs to altitude with the issue at hand. Considering that this issue had been documented two times in the past few days with a Number 2 Engine high vibration issue; a return to the field was a prudent decision. In the process; we were vectored around in order to get our landing weight below our limitation and had a successful landing on Runway XX in ZZZ. No emergency was declared during this incident.In retrospect; I felt that my first officer and I conducted the situation very professionally; safely and successfully. In all; I made my pilot in command decision to return to field based on the safety of the flight and souls on board my airplane. With a documented history of engine vibrations within the past few days; I do not regret nor question my decision. The engine vibration was abnormally in the caution range and I simply matched my decision based off of that; acting on the side of caution for the safety of my passengers; crew and aircraft. There was no way that I was willing to continue a high power climb to a high altitude with a vibration in the caution range; a documented maintenance history within the past few days and not knowing the potentially hazardous issues that could take place ahead.

	["Flight XXXX at FL340 in cruise flight; cleared direct to ZZZZZ intersection to join the XXXXX arrival to ZZZ and cleared to cross ZZZZZ1 at FL270. Just after top of descent in VNAV when the throttles powered back for descent a loud bang came from the left side of the aircraft followed by significant airframe vibration.

I brought the Number 2 Throttle to idle but the vibration continued and severe damage was determined. We ran the severe damage checklist and secured the engine and then requested a slower speed from ATC to lessen the vibration and advised ATC. The slower speed made the vibration acceptable and the flight continued to descend on the arrival via ATC instructions. The FO was dispatched to the main deck to visually survey damage. He returned with pictures of obvious catastrophic damage of the Number 2 Engine and confirmed no visible damage to the leading edge or any other visible portion of the left side of the aircraft.

	["The flight to ZZZ was uneventful until the descent. ATC held us high as we transitioned over ZZZ1 which left us extremely high for the approach into ZZZ. When we reported the field in sight for the visual approach we realized that we were far too high to complete an approach successfully and so we coordinated with approach to maneuver in order to add track miles for the descent. We ended up making a 270 degree turn to final which put us level at traffic pattern altitude and slightly offset for the straight in visual to Runway 12 at about 10 miles out. Even with the extra track miles to lose altitude; the descent from the mid-20s down to traffic pattern altitude was fairly time compressed. As the Captain (Pilot Flying) maneuvered us fully onto final approach he performed the LVSA procedure as we had the FMC set up with a visual approach to Runway 12 and our plan was to fly it like a RNAV approach. During this time; I was busy helping the Captain configure and making radio calls (we were talking to both ZZZ2 approach and making CTAF calls). Because of this I failed to notice that when the Captain performed LVSA he didn't set a lower altitude. This meant that when we reached the top of descent for the final descent the aircraft did not descend and started getting high on final. I realized what was going on and pointed this out to the Captain who left the autopilot on initially and tried to descend to catch the descent path using different vertical modes. However; since the aircraft was slow to respond on the autopilot; we did not catch the final approach path. As we passed 1;000 ft.; I was making a CTAF call but heard the Captain call stable. After I finished my radio call; when I went to call 'stable' I noticed that we were not actually stable as we had a vertical speed of 1;600 fpm. I called 'unstable; go-around' and the Captain immediately started the go around procedure. We performed a go-around and climbed up to traffic pattern altitude with the speed intervened and holding the configuration at Flaps 5. I made a call to CTAF and then contacted approach who offered us the choice of maneuvering visually in the traffic pattern for another attempt at landing or offered to take us out and vector us around for another visual. After consulting with the Captain; we decided to just perform a left traffic pattern in visual conditions. The Captain flew the traffic pattern while I performed all the necessary checklists and set up the FMC again for a visual to Runway 12. When we loaded the visual approach into the FMC it automatically set up an 8 mile fix on final. We turned base about 5 miles from the runway due to terrain further out from the airport and while on the base leg I sequenced the FMS for the Captain since we were inside the 8 mile final approach fix. However; by the time the FMS had caught up on its calculations and the Captain had made the appropriate selections on the MCP; we were once again getting high on the approach. The Captain realized this and again tried to correct the problem with the autopilot on and a vertical mode but once again the aircraft was too slow to respond. This time though the Captain realized prior to 1;000 ft. that this approach wasn't going to work out either and leveled off. He suggested we just fly a 360 turn on final to help with the situation and started to turn crosswind. I stated that I was uncomfortable with this and thought we needed to climb back up to traffic pattern altitude at least. The Captain agreed that this would be prudent and climbed back up to 3;500 ft. while I got us set up for another attempt. Instead of flying just a 360 turn; the Captain ended up flying another small traffic pattern; however; this time the Captain flew the pattern and approach with the autopilot off. The Captain flew a normal visual pattern and this time we were on path and fully stabilized prior to 1;000 ft. The Captain then performed an uneventful landing. Additionally; after landing we had greatdifficulty getting our flight plan closed. We were unable to raise FSS on the ground via radio as expected; then multiple attempted calls to [TRACON] via phone were unsuccessful; and finally after the second phone call to FSS we were finally able to get our flight plan closed. Although it didn't get closed within the 5 minutes of landing that approach had requested because of all the problems we had. In retrospect we let approach rush us in the descent prior to accepting the visual approach into ZZZ; we should have gotten delay vectors so we weren't so rushed going into the approach. Also; it would have been better if we would have taken the option from approach to get vectors around for a second attempt rather than just flying the traffic pattern.

	["When we landed at ZZZ it was completely after dark.  ATC cleared our E190 Flight XXX to hold short of Rwy XXR on Taxiway E.  Then we were cleared to cross Rwy XXR at E and contact ground on the other side.  This area is marked as a [Hot Spot] on the ZZZ airport diagram. After crossing we turned off all lights and changed to ground.  Congestion on frequency prevented quick access.  Directly ahead a company aircraft turned on their taxi light and began to taxi directly at us.  At the intersection of E and Taxiway A the aircraft stopped momentarily and turned off its taxi light.  Inexplicably; the Company aircraft then started to taxi directly at us again with lights out.  Alarmed; I turned on our taxi and Landing lights to warn the approaching flight crew of our position; so that they could see that it was too dangerous to continue.  Our FO warned the flight crew multiple times on ground frequency that there was not enough room to make the left turn safely.  The aircraft then turned on their Lights and continued to slowly make the turn despite repeated warnings.  Someone else on ground frequency made an arrogant comment about taxiing.  Although we never heard their taxi instructions; they apparently had a clearance that did not take into account our stationary position within the intersection of E and B.  With all of the lights we could clearly see the nose wheel of an Airbus A319 well to the inside of the yellow left turn taxiway markings on the transition from E to B taxiways.  The nose wheel was estimated to be about 5' to the left of the yellow centerline.  The right wing sharklet passed somewhere between 5' and 10'  of our windshield.  We could not see whether the left engine or the left main gear made contact with any obstructions; FOD; or taxi lights.  This company aircraft had come so dangerously close to our aircraft that the safety of our passengers; crew; and both aircraft were seriously Jeopardized. CausePoor judgment in taxiing an aircraft into such close proximity to another aircraft after repeated warnings to stop and wait. Failure to stop and request an amended clearance.  Both the E190 and A319 were placed into unacceptably close proximity by failing to acknowledge all warnings to stop briefly so as to maintain a safe operation.  The safety of both aircraft; passengers; and crew were seriously jeopardized by this imprudent decision.Stop when requested so an amended clearance could be issued and wait for a stationary aircraft to move out of the way.

	["After landing on Runway 22L we exited the runway via Taxiway P; E and held short of Runway 22R at E. We were talking to Tower on Frequency 128.80. Tower advised to cross Runway 22R on E and contact ground on Frequency 121.9 once crossed. The Captain taxied across Runway 22R and I was contacting ground on 121.90 when we realized there was an Air Carrier Y coming strait at us on Taxiway E. The Captain stopped immediately and I tried to contact ground. Ground Control was very busy and I was unable to get a response from him. I continued to try and contact ground by saying something along the lines of ground Air Carrier X I think our tail is still across the hold short line on Runway 22R and that there was an aircraft coming strait at us from Taxiway E. I believe ground still did not respond. By this time the Air Carrier Y was about 50 feet in front of us and still coming. I said to the Captain; 'he's going to hit us.' The Captain then turned on every light we had so as to have the Air Carrier Y stop. I yelled on the radio multiple times to 'stop!' The Air Carrier Y kept coming. Ground still did not respond. I then again said the Air Carrier Y in front of us stop you are going to hit us. A voice came on and said; 'I can see my wing I'm fine; I'm not going to hit you;' I said 'yes you are; STOP!' The Air Carrier Y kept coming slower; but turned to cut the corner of Taxiway E and B; exactly where we were sitting. By the time the Air Carrier Y went past us; it's front tires were about 5 feet left of the taxiway line (cutting the inside of the corner) I would calculate the winglet of the Air Carrier Y was about 5 feet from our front windshield. My Captain kept the lights on the whole time and never moved the airplane; if he would have moved there would have been a collision. Once the Air Carrier Y passed I was finally able to get taxi confirmation from ground to continue to the gate.I believe the event occurred because the pilot of the Air Carrier Y was arrogant. This is most prevalent in my mind because of the tone of voice that was given when he said; he would not hit us. Also Ground not realizing that Tower had cleared us to cross and contact Ground Control.

	["It is my opinion that we had made our departure CTAF broadcast at the same time as Aircraft Y and that caused us to not hear each other.  We had observed 3 different aircraft using Runway 17 (our inbound aircraft; a departing airline flight and an arriving airline flight) and elected to use 17 in effort to not disrupt flow of traffic.  Leaving ZZZ we taxied to RWY 17 from the terminal ramp making 2 CTAF calls en route; one for taxi and one for crossing 31/13.  At the end of the runway I called Center via phone to obtain clearance as stated by NOTAM and got clearance after confusion over call sign since ours was missing on our release paperwork.  After 15 minutes or so we were released by center.  I looked down the runway and saw no traffic and asked the Captain if he was ready.  He replied yes and I made a CTAF call saying 'ZZZ traffic; [Callsign]; departing Runway 17 with a right turnout; ZZZ' (the right turnout was misspoken).  We observed no traffic and had heard no radio calls from anyone other than an ops vehicle that appeared to be inspecting Runway 31 (does not intersect 17).  We waited for approximately 15 seconds before we took the runway as we completed the before takeoff checklist.  I once again called clear right while looking down the runway and observing no traffic.  On the roll I was given flight controls and advanced power.  As rotate was called I noticed a light on the departure end of the runway.  We took off normally and flew the ZZZ1 departure; and during initial climb I noted Aircraft Y on the 1000 foot markers for Runway 35.  At this point we heard a CTAF call from the aircraft but I do not recall the exact wording from the other aircraft.  We briefly communicated with the other aircraft before swapping to Center and continuing to ZZZ2.I believe us stepping on each others broadcast caused us to miss one another's departure call.  The departure end of 17 has buildings that made it somewhat more difficult to spot traffic and the sun was in our face towards the departure end of 17.\nI believe that when we made our transmission before taking the runway we may have stepped on Aircraft Y making the same transmission at the other end of the runway. Due to that I don't think either of us heard the other aircraft. I chose to use Runway 17 due to the calm winds and that being the runway that every other aircraft had been using since we had been out on the airfield. I felt with other aircraft using Runway 17 it would be the least disruptive to the flow of the airport. In addition taking off on Runway 17 there was glare from the sun; and also a group of buildings off the departure end that helped hide Aircraft Y from sight.Departing ZZZ off of Runway 17; we had taxied to the end from the ramp. FO made two radio calls during the taxi; once for the initial taxi and then again when we crossed the intersecting Runway; 31/13. While holding short at the end of the runway I instructed the first officer to call Center via a phone number for clearance delivery out of ZZZ. There was some confusion over our flight number being filed as XXXA instead of XXX; as it wasn't in our remarks section of our paperwork and was only present in the ATC strip. We continued holding short of Runway 17 at the end for around 10-15 minutes while we double checked with dispatch and got our release from center. We were given our release and I asked the First Officer to double check the departure end was clear; I looked as much as I could and didn't see anything. He responded that it was clear and asked if I was ready. The first officer transmitted on COM2 on 122.80; as listed in the Lido charts; stating '[Callsign]; taking Runway 17 for departure; Right turn out.' We heard no responding traffic; took one more opportunity to look at both ends of the runway; and began to taxi out on to the runway after around 10 seconds or so. Upon alignment with the runway we again spotted no traffic on the runway; however there was a good amount of glare from the sun. I handed the first officer the controls and we began our takeoff roll. Right around Vr I noticed a light at the other end of the runway; and as we rotated I saw Aircraft Y pass well beneath us as they aborted their takeoff on Runway 35. He was around the 1;000 foot markers of Runway 35; and we were a good 500-1000 feet above him. The other aircraft made a CTAF call saying that we did not make any transmissions and they were aborting their takeoff. I responded that we had made multiple transmissions taxiing out to the runway; as well as another before taxiing onto the runway. He responded that he didn't hear anything we had said and that he was making radio calls as well. We continued with the departure and proceeded to Denver without further incident.I think that making more than one departure call would have helped negate this incident. Perhaps if we had made a '[Callsign] holding short Runway 17 ready for departure; any other traffic please advise' call before making our 'taking Runway 17 for departure' call it could have given the other aircraft more opportunity to hear and avoid us. The departing traffic was also VFR; so there was no separation provided from ATC; which would have helped but also we can't expect every aircraft to fly IFR all the time.", {"entities": [[2302, 2306, "WEATHER"], [216, 225, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [248, 256, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [353, 359, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [363, 366, "ABBREVIATION"], [379, 387, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [388, 392, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [483, 489, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [549, 554, "ABBREVIATION"], [724, 730, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [764, 771, "CREW"], [861, 870, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [984, 989, "AIRPLANE"], [1159, 1165, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1193, 1200, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1268, 1274, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1430, 1436, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1442, 1450, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1464, 1468, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1500, 1513, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1540, 1549, "ALTITUDE"], [2099, 2105, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2193, 2199, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2332, 2338, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2409, 2417, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2535, 2545, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2680, 2689, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2719, 2725, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2746, 2750, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2752, 2754, "ABBREVIATION"], [2764, 2769, "AIRPLANE"], [2888, 2895, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2920, 2926, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2944, 2957, "CREW"], [3192, 3195, "CREW"], [3216, 3223, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3392, 3405, "CREW"], [3565, 3578, "CREW"], [3796, 3802, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3817, 3821, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3836, 3842, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3898, 3904, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3940, 3946, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4016, 4029, "CREW"], [4060, 4067, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4132, 4138, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4218, 4225, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4258, 4268, "ALTITUDE"], [4314, 4323, "ALTITUDE"], [4446, 4453, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4507, 4514, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4526, 4532, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4560, 4567, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4577, 4583, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4662, 4667, "AIRPLANE"], [4890, 4897, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5111, 5120, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5138, 5141, "ABBREVIATION"], [5184, 5187, "CREW"], [5256, 5259, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5260, 5263, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],
	["Just prior to the top of descent I sensed a smoky odor in the cockpit. After a brief monitor of the sensation; the phenomena increased in intensity. I asked the First Officer to confirm the presence of smoke; which he confirmed. At that point; as a precaution I commanded the First Officer that we don oxygen masks and request ATC for a descent to 12;000 [feet] to prepare for corrective action in the event that the event became fully abnormal. The First Officer communicated to ATC that we required an immediate descent due to the presence of smoke in the cockpit. ATC cleared us initially to 16;000 [feet]; then shortly after; to 12;000 feet. Subsequently; we were to become aware that ATC advised for us. Descending through 16;000 feet; we observed that the smoke didn't appear to intensify. I asked the First Officer to remove his mask to assess the cockpit environment. After all appeared clear; we removed our oxygen masks and proceeded to run through the smoke abnormal checklist. From that point to landing; we monitored the situation and attempted to troubleshoot the source of the smoke. At the conclusion I contacted the Chief Pilot; Maintenance and Dispatch to describe our circumstances. A maintenance write up was entered in the Aircraft Flight Maintenance Log. A Mechanic was dispatched to our location and after performing an inspection; returned the aircraft to service. Oxygen mask lenses should be cleaned or checked for hazing. It was very difficult to effectively observe cockpit instruments and switches because the mask lens was extremely hazed or dusty.\nJust prior to planned top of descent from 32;000 [feet]; Captain indicated he smelt and saw smoke in the cabin. Emergency memory items for smoke in cockpit were immediately performed and O2 masks were placed on; O2 mask microphone was activated; and ATC was advised we had smoke in the cockpit. Lowest possible sector altitude was requested and a descent was begun to 12;000 [feet]. We continued to ZZZ in descent. ATC advised for us. At 16;000 feet I removed my mask as I did not see smoke. The Captain removed his mask shortly thereafter. I performed QRH checklist items for SMOKE and smoke/burnt smell evident in the cockpit. O2 masks - Don; o2 mask mike - activate; ZZZ was nearest suitable; seatbelt/no smoking switches to On; RECIRC-EFIS-AVIONIC FAN - Off. Spoke to Flight Attendant and asks if she had smoke in passenger compartment - she did not. Continued with checklist for smoke/burnt smell evident in flight compartment. MAN CAB ALT sector - turn gradually to UP (Captain instructed me not to do this). We suspected BLEED source and I proceeded to AIR CONDITION SMOKE REMOVAL on QRH EMERG -18. SMOKE procedure was completed and continued with smoke/burnt smell primarily entering the flight compartment.  RH ECS BLEED - OFF; X-BLEED - On; EMERGENCY DESCENT was being performed. We continued descent and flight path to ZZZ as nearest suitable and performed a visual approach and landed on RWY XX at ZZZ with out needing to perform a ground evacuation.", {"entities": [[202, 207, "WEATHER"], [545, 550, "WEATHER"], [762, 767, "WEATHER"], [963, 968, "WEATHER"], [1092, 1097, "WEATHER"], [1671, 1676, "WEATHER"], [1718, 1723, "WEATHER"], [1852, 1857, "WEATHER"], [2064, 2069, "WEATHER"], [2166, 2171, "WEATHER"], [2388, 2393, "WEATHER"], [2463, 2468, "WEATHER"], [2734, 2739, "WEATHER"], [25, 32, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [62, 69, "AIRPLANE"], [161, 174, "CREW"], [276, 289, "CREW"], [327, 330, "CREW"], [337, 344, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [355, 360, "ALTITUDE"], [450, 463, "CREW"], [480, 483, "CREW"], [514, 521, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [558, 565, "AIRPLANE"], [567, 570, "CREW"], [602, 607, "ALTITUDE"], [633, 644, "ALTITUDE"], [689, 692, "CREW"], [709, 719, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [728, 739, "ALTITUDE"], [808, 821, "CREW"], [855, 862, "AIRPLANE"], [1146, 1157, "CREW"], [1162, 1170, "CREW"], [1204, 1215, "CREW"], [1260, 1271, "CREW"], [1279, 1287, "CREW"], [1494, 1501, "AIRPLANE"], [1608, 1615, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1628, 1633, "ALTITUDE"], [1636, 1643, "CREW"], [1684, 1689, "AIRPLANE"], [1727, 1734, "AIRPLANE"], [1829, 1832, "CREW"], [1865, 1872, "AIRPLANE"], [1926, 1933, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1954, 1959, "ALTITUDE"], [1985, 1992, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1994, 1997, "CREW"], [2017, 2028, "ALTITUDE"], [2075, 2082, "CREW"], [2132, 2135, "ABBREVIATION"], [2199, 2206, "AIRPLANE"], [2318, 2322, "ABBREVIATION"], [2516, 2519, "ABBREVIATION"], [2555, 2562, "CREW"], [2670, 2673, "ABBREVIATION"], [2840, 2847, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2882, 2889, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2949, 2964, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2969, 2975, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2979, 2982, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

	["Aircraft had engine wash [the] night before flight. During taxi and takeoff noticed foul stench from aircraft conditioned air. Went from bad during takeoff roll to worse on initial climb. Slowly dissipated but not without crew consideration of in flight return.  Finally tolerable at about 6-10 thousand feet and didn't notice again until descent below 10 thousand feet. Odor was foul but not threatening.\nWhen the thrust was pushed up for takeoff a bad; musty odor came through the flight deck vents. It smelled like an old; musty; wet basement. As we climbed above the clouds (around 1;000-2;000 [feet]) the smell began to dissipate. It was bad enough that I reached down and partially closed my gasper and concurrently asked if anyone else (we had a jumpseater) could smell that. If the smell had lasted any longer; I thought about calling for the Smoke; Fire; and Fumes QRC but it had begun to dissipate by that point. We talked about the smell and decided it was probably related to the foggy; humid conditions in ZZZ. It was a 'wet pack' smell. It did not smell like smoke or have an acrid; or burning scent. On descent into ZZZ1 as we began to pass through a cloud layer (somewhere around 18;000 [feet]) the smell came back. As soon as we passed out of the clouds the smell began to dissipate. It was at this point that the Captain decided to make an ELB entry. Once at the gate we talked with a mechanic to pass on the conditions that we noticed the smell: 1. engine bleeds on 2. first noticed at a high thrust setting but later came back at a lower setting 3. when in a moist environment (clouds and fog). A little while later; ZZZ1 Flight Ops called and asked if I could meet with a mechanic to discuss the event again since I was waiting for a deadhead flight and they were trying to troubleshoot. As we were discussing where to meet; they realized the plane had undergone a compressor wash on the overnight and attributed the odor to that. It made sense because the Captain had told me he was surprised on the walk around that the engine lips had some type of greasy liquid on them; but thought it must have been residual deice fluid. He also had noticed on the preflight that the engine bleeds had been turned off; which is an unusual configuration to find while preflighting.", {"entities": [[1073, 1078, "WEATHER"], [1172, 1177, "WEATHER"], [1609, 1612, "WEATHER"], [13, 19, "AIRPLANE"], [68, 75, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [148, 155, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [173, 186, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [295, 308, "ALTITUDE"], [339, 346, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [356, 369, "ALTITUDE"], [440, 447, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [553, 560, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [598, 603, "ALTITUDE"], [1118, 1125, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1203, 1208, "ALTITUDE"], [1331, 1338, "CREW"], [1358, 1361, "ABBREVIATION"], [1381, 1385, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1468, 1474, "AIRPLANE"], [1978, 1985, "CREW"], [2043, 2049, "AIRPLANE"], [2174, 2183, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2193, 2199, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["Uneventful approach and landing from ILS 03 approach. Light weight aircraft. We reported braking action good after landing rollout (first aircraft to land). Turn off runway at B5 was normal and completed after landing checklist. The B5 taxiway definitely looked slippery due to its reflectivity. ATIS was reporting 1/8 slush all taxiways. I fly this trip multiple times every month and I am very familiar with the slight downslope of the taxiway prior to the left turn onto the 60 ft wide taxiway H. I approached the left turn with extreme caution and the slowest possible speed; however as I initiated the turn onto H the aircraft only turned slightly off the B5 centerline before beginning to slide straight ahead. I was immediately aware that the aircraft was sliding and applied maximum break application when the aircraft did not turn. The slide continued approximately 20-40 feet before I was able to stop the aircraft with application of minimal idle reverse and the maximum brake application. I believe our light weight and residual thrust was a factor on a slight downslope surface that was contaminated with frozen slush. Relative to the runway and our ramp area it appeared that there was minimal sand applied to that taxiway intersection. Once stopped I set the parking brake. We stopped ON the taxiway surface and SLIGHTLY left of centerline; but unable to attempt another turn onto taxiway H. We advised tower of our predicament and informed them we would need to contact our ramp to coordinate a tow-in by Maintenance. Tower had no issue with our actions or need for assistance. The aircraft was towed to the gate with no further issues and there was no damage to the aircraft. I called the duty officer upon arrival at the ramp to relay the details of the required tow to the ramp. Our very experienced maintenance personnel reported to me that airport ops would have an interest in the occurrence. As it turned out; the duty officer called me back once I had arrived at the layover hotel to inform me that the Deputy Chief of Airport Ops wanted to get a statement from me. I called the Deputy Chief immediately and respectfully declined to make a written statement; but verbally provided the same details I have provided here. I respectfully directed him to re-contact the duty officer for direction to retrieve the data he wanted through our safety reporting system. I; again; called the duty officer to inform him of my polite interaction with [the deputy]. Duty Officer concurred with my decision not to provide written statement which was very helpful on his part. During my conversation with the Deputy Chief; I expressly complimented the Ops crew that provides a runway in very good condition for landing every morning in spite of the often foul weather conditions. In spite of doing all we could as a crew to analyze; brief and take action to mitigate what we knew to be the threat of taxiways in poor condition we as a crew and I; specifically as the Captain; was unable to execute a safe taxi to the ramp in icy conditions. Poor decision making; human error. Although I have operated this flight into Appleton many times and have taxied to the ramp in what I would consider conditions that were much worse than today; perhaps (in hindsight) I should have requested a tow-in before attempting the turn onto the 60 ft foot wide H taxiway. I believe the taxiway condition was worse than I realized and considerably worse than the reported 1/8 slush. 'Skating rink' would have been a better description.

	["While descending along the I believe around 18;000 ft. we hit a pretty strong first bump. Followed by smooth air and then another very large violent bump. Again followed by smooth air I believe the altitude was around 16;500 ft. and then we encountered severe turbulence. I originally had the flight spoilers out to help the descent to make the crossing altitude and speed at the first altitude speed fix. The turbulence was the worst I have ever experienced which the Captain had also said was the worst. The airspeed began increasing to the point we were going to overspeed so I powered back and decreased the rate of descent as I was descending in vertical speed mode. The turbulence had gotten so severe I couldn't even read the instruments displays. We then had a very large and immediate decrease in speed of 50 kts. in the matter of seconds which then forced me to go into the climb detent again. I had at some point in the craziness of the turbulence hit my head on the ceiling of the aircraft. I did have my seat belt fastened but I do not remember if I had the shoulder harnesses on as we were above 10;000 ft. My first reaction in all of this was to maintain control of the airplane not to get my shoulder harness on and possibly stall the airplane.At one point I saw an area with no clouds to the right and told the Captain to ask for an immediate right deviation. The frequency was blocked so I took authority and immediately turn 90 degrees to the right and thankfully a minute later it smoothed out between 10;000 to 12;000 ft. I did realize in the descent that I did have the flight spoilers out 2 to 3 notches due to the aircraft nearly over speeding but had forgot to stow them due to the flight situation we were encountering. I did stow them as soon as I realized they were still deployed. During the initial severe turbulence the Captain went to advise the Flight Attendants over the phone so I had the radios and was pilot flying and advised Center or approach of the situation and they came back saying there was only moderate reported before I could barely speak due to the vibrations of the severe turbulence but advised we are in severe. They had asked if anyone was hurt or if there was any aircraft damage which I told them I do not know the answer to either but I will advise when we can. We advised them when we were out of the severe that there weren't any passenger injuries and we don't believe if there was any aircraft damage but we couldn't see what was going on outside.At some point in the severe turbulence the Captain had gotten her hand or wrist slammed against something which she was in pain for crying the rest of the flight. When we both got on the ground I felt okay originally but then as the adrenaline began to wear off I began having a splitting headache and soar-ness on the top of my head.

The Day Emergency Power Supply Routine test; ( that you did by pushing the EPS test button for 5 seconds looking for a green light ); was now in fact a 180 day Removal/replacement for routine test.

Or look at the requirements and think; the description is not correct because the reference says 12 month cap check. Everything you do to maintain an aircraft is reference. No reference you have to look it up to see how to do an inspection or a service.

	["A321 aft lavatories; X and Y; have a folding door that acts as a partition to separate the two lav compartments. This door/partition is secured closed and locked under normal operational conditions. The inbound flight had a pilot defect report stating; 'Locking wall between aft lavs locking mechanism broken.' I and Technician Y responded to the gate call. Technician Y was told by the pilot that while both aft lavs were in use the door/partition opened exposing the occupants to each other. We discovered that the locking mechanism was loose within the door assembly and would only operate intermittently to lock or unlock the door. We also believed that parts of the locking mechanism may have broken off and fallen away from the assembly within the door. At this point I proceeded to the flight deck to begin the MEL process. Technician Y was able to jostle the locking mechanism and get the door to close and lock. He then covered the lock and handle with tape. When I called Maintenance control I was told that there is no MEL available to address this issue. I was also told that deactivating both aft lavs was not an option either. When Technician Y and I returned to the Maintenance line office; I informed the Supervisor; NNNN1 of the situation. The necessary parts for repair were not in stock. I was called into the Supervisor's office three different times to explain the problem to Maintenance Control; who continued to insist that the aircraft must be ready to go at XA00. While in the office the 3rd time; Maintenance Control ended the call and then called the supervisor back; requesting that I not hear what is going to be said.

	["This incident occurred shortly after XA:00 local time. Winds were calm and I selected RWY 22 due to weather/cloud conditions rather than circle to 4. A cloud layer at 2;100 had been reported on previous AWOS.From the air; I could see that there was contamination on the runway and had heard the previous pilots land without incident. There were no NOTAMs published or information available on AWOS regarding runway conditions. I requested from CTAF runway information but received no information. As I turned onto final; I was extremely vigilant with my reference speed and touchdown zone. When I crossed the threshold; the plane floated for a moment and we touched down. The runway length was approximately 7;000 feet total. Landing performance with contaminated runway was within limits.I deployed ground spoilers; waited for the airplane to decelerate and started applying brakes. At that point; we moved slightly left and as I continued to apply and use rudder the aircraft went into a slide and exited on the left side of the runway. When we entered the slide; I had zero control. I had about 3;500 feet left when we started to aggressively slide off; the aircraft coming to a halt about 1;500-2;000 feet prior to the end.  Human factors would include single pilot operations and not having the time to communicate with the FBO about additional runway conditions. The pilot ahead of me did request this information and was told the runway was a 5. When I spoke with him; he said that it was definitely a 3 and while they didn't apply brakes (KingAir); it was apparent it was very slippery.When we exited the aircraft; I immediately inspected the runway conditions and they were exceptionally icy. The type of ice that is created when a plow moves over the surface close to the ground and leaves a uniform and smooth surface. In addition; the areas that were clear; had ice. So while it appeared patchy; I believe the surface was largely ice.From an operational standpoint; having better information from the ground would have vastly changed my decision. From my perspective; I would not land on a runway that is only a 3. It was an easy diversion to ZZZ1 and we were planning on this in the event conditions were within our limits.In trying to assess all possible contributing factors; had weather conditions been more favorable; RWY 4 would have been a better option as we could have assessed the runway conditions as well as had more time to assure a stabilized approach.

	["I was the Captain flying from ZZZZ. We landed on Runway 10 in ZZZZ at approximately XA47Z. We landed in ZZZZ and taxied to the South ramp to clear customs. After clearing customs; we started the aircraft up and taxied to the North ramp to be parked in position for our outbound fight. While taxiing to the other side of the airport it began to rain. It was raining enough that the wipers were needed to see in front of us.We had a marshaler guiding us into our parking spot. It was one situated in a position where we needed to nose in; and turn 180 degrees to face out.  He instructed us to turn right into the empty spot facing a wall. He then instructed us to turn right again.  As I turned the aircraft to the right (parallel to the wall and the taxiway) Co-pilot noticed the marshaler may have been getting us close to a GPU situated along the wall. Co-pilot asked 'are we clear?' I slowed the plane; basically to a stop to look back as far as I could. From what I saw through the rain covered side window we were clear of the GPU. I then moved my attention the the marshaler who instructed me to turn right yet again to face out (in line; wingtip to wingtip with the other parked planes).

He was able to push it along the wall away from the aircraft.

	["Flying an IFR flight plan from ZZZ to ZZZ1; I was PIC; pilot flying. Dual crew; flying the XXX departure VIA radar vectors. In contact with center we were 'stepped up' to flight level 260. Once reaching 260; the 'cab press' (cabin pressure) CAWS illuminated. I gave controls to the SIC while I donned my O2 mask and took controls back and requested a descent and turn back to ZZZ mean while the SIC could read from the Emergency Checklist. Once I determined that the cabin pressure was maintaining pressure correctly according to the pressure gauge; I determined that an emergency descent was not imminent; but had the SIC and passengers don O2 masks while we completed a precautionary descent. We were not able to get to an acceptable lower altitude below 15k feet for O2 requirements for terrain on an IFR flight plan; so I requested VFR and continued my descent. The CAB PRESS CAWS went away between 18 and 16k feet. Once getting to an acceptable altitude; we removed and instructed passengers to remove O2 while we contacted ZZZ Approach; did a pop up IFR Flight plan into ZZZ and landed safely. Somewhere between 14 and 10k feet our pressure spiked and hurt the passengers and SICs ear drums. Again upon landing in ZZZ; we did a normal landing with full reverse input where the pressure again spiked. Multiple passengers complained about their ears upon landing and the SIC went to urgent care for complaining about pain in her ears; a 'liquid feeling' in her ears; and later determining that she had blood in her ear canals.Although; I did not feel that this situation did not require declaring an emergency; this plane has been written up MELed for both of these issues multiple times in the past and 'OPS CHECKED GOOD'.", {"entities": [[231, 239, "WEATHER"], [473, 481, "WEATHER"], [498, 506, "WEATHER"], [534, 542, "WEATHER"], [1138, 1146, "WEATHER"], [1283, 1291, "WEATHER"], [0, 6, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [10, 13, "ABBREVIATION"], [55, 60, "CREW"], [80, 86, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [225, 230, "AIRPLANE"], [351, 358, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [467, 472, "AIRPLANE"], [581, 588, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [686, 693, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [757, 765, "ALTITUDE"], [804, 807, "ABBREVIATION"], [836, 839, "ABBREVIATION"], [857, 864, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [870, 873, "ABBREVIATION"], [910, 918, "ALTITUDE"], [1033, 1041, "CREW"], [1056, 1059, "ABBREVIATION"], [1085, 1091, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1125, 1133, "ALTITUDE"]]}],

I immediately cut all power by turning off the avionics master. This stopped the smoke/smell. I then found the appropriate breaker and pulled it and restored avionics power as we donned oxygen masks. We then advised ATC and requested an immediate descent. We were within 10 miles of ZZZ2 and requested a vector to this airport and were cleared to descend by Center and given a vector to ZZZ2. We descended at 3;500 feet per minute and were given step down altitudes to rapidly line up to land on [Runway] XXL. We did require a right 270 degree turn to lose altitude and landed uneventfully.

	["The FO (First Officer) flying with the autopilot on and myself as the pilot monitoring. We were at 4;000 ft with flaps at 15 or 20 and airspeed of 180 kias on a dogleg base vector to final when we heard a muffled boom/bang sound followed immediately by a yaw of the aircraft. This was followed by an EICAS MSG: Rt Eng Stator and Rt Eng Oil Press. Engines indications and subsequent EICAS messages confirmed that the right engine had failed. I [requested priority handling] with ATC and proceeded to perform the Engine Failure Checklist on the QRC while the FO continued to fly the aircraft. At the point where the QRC said to proceed to the QRH we were on final for RWY 22L and descending to 3;000 ft. I made the decision to suspend the checklist at this point and the FO and I quickly discussed if we were comfortable continuing the approach and landing. We briefed a flaps 20 single engine landing and go-around if it became necessary. The speeds in the FMC were reset for a flaps 20 landing. We continued to configure the aircraft for landing. I then called back to [the] FAs and told them that we had lost the Rt Engine; we would be landing in approximately 2 minutes and to prep the cabin for a possible evacuation. I confirmed with Tower that the emergency equipment would be there on landing. On short final we got the aural warning of 'Too low; flaps'. We realized this was due to the flaps 20 configuration; single engine landing we were doing I quickly selected the GND PROX FLAP OVRD switch to OVRD. An uneventful flaps 20; single engine landing was made by the FO. We rolled out and exited the runway at Taxiway N. We had no other abnormal indications and I decided to taxi the aircraft to the gate with the emergency equipment following us. Emergency personnel and Station Maintenance personnel met the aircraft. They informed us that they could not see any visible signs of damage. We proceeded to debrief Station Maintenance on what had happened. Calls were made to Dispatch; the Flight Operations and [the] Maintenance Control engine shop to inform them of the incident.Total time from the engine failure to landing was approximately 5 minutes.Numerous times in my [XX]+ years at [company]; as well as while flying in the military; the topic of what would you do with an engine failure on final has come up. In virtually every discussion; the consensus was that; barring any adverse conditions or controllability problems with the aircraft; we would continue and land flaps 20 if not fully configured or 25-30 if we were. Having had those discussions made things much easier and contributed to the successful outcome of this incident.After arriving at the gate; the Purser informed me that there had been some confusion on their end. When I called back to the FAs to inform them of the [situation]; another FA had answered the call. According to the Purser; the confusion came when the FA who answered relayed the information to her. By the time we finished briefing maintenance and exited the flight deck the passengers and FAs had all deplaned. As a result; we were unable to conduct a debriefing with entire crew.\nWe were being vectored for approach into ZZZ Runway XXL in VMC conditions. At 4;000 ft on a right base approximately 2 miles from the turn to final we heard a dull thump followed by a right yaw. This was followed by numerous EICAS messages including RIGHT ENGINE STATOR FAIL and a rapid drop in oil pressure to approximately 24 psi within 2 or 3 seconds. We recognized the right engine failure and [advised ATC]. I was the flying pilot and elected to keep the autopilot engaged during the initial moments of the engine failure to help sort out the aircraft state. We ran the items from the engine failure section of the QRC to secure the right engine. At this time we both agreed the safest plan was to continue the approach single engine due to our extreme close proximity to ZZZ. Landing speeds were reset for flaps 20 and I disengaged the autopilot just prior to localizer intercept. We quickly briefed that the go around procedure would now require flaps 5. On short final we did get the aural warning 'too low flaps' but quickly selected the GROUND PROXIMITY FLAP OVERRIDE switch to OVERRIDE to correct the problem. The rest of the approach was flown and landed without further incident. We taxied to the gate after landing accompanied by fire rescue.", {"entities": [[3432, 3440, "WEATHER"], [4, 6, "ABBREVIATION"], [8, 21, "CREW"], [23, 29, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [39, 48, "AIRPLANE"], [70, 75, "CREW"], [99, 107, "ALTITUDE"], [168, 172, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [300, 305, "AIRPLANE"], [382, 387, "AIRPLANE"], [422, 428, "AIRPLANE"], [478, 481, "CREW"], [557, 559, "ABBREVIATION"], [573, 576, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [641, 644, "ABBREVIATION"], [666, 669, "ABBREVIATION"], [678, 688, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [692, 700, "ALTITUDE"], [769, 771, "ABBREVIATION"], [834, 842, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [885, 891, "AIRPLANE"], [904, 913, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1137, 1144, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1188, 1193, "AIRPLANE"], [1238, 1243, "CREW"], [1424, 1430, "AIRPLANE"], [1476, 1479, "ABBREVIATION"], [1542, 1548, "AIRPLANE"], [1573, 1575, "ABBREVIATION"], [1606, 1612, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1681, 1685, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1706, 1710, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1786, 1797, "CREW"], [1928, 1939, "CREW"], [1981, 1989, "CREW"], [2023, 2034, "CREW"], [2043, 2049, "AIRPLANE"], [2106, 2112, "AIRPLANE"], [2224, 2230, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2287, 2293, "AIRPLANE"], [2479, 2483, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2656, 2664, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2672, 2676, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2983, 2994, "CREW"], [3160, 3168, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3211, 3219, "ALTITUDE"], [3231, 3235, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3358, 3363, "AIRPLANE"], [3461, 3464, "ABBREVIATION"], [3512, 3518, "AIRPLANE"], [3540, 3543, "CREW"], [3556, 3562, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3563, 3568, "CREW"], [3593, 3602, "AIRPLANE"], [3645, 3651, "AIRPLANE"], [3723, 3729, "AIRPLANE"], [3777, 3783, "AIRPLANE"], [3849, 3857, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3865, 3871, "AIRPLANE"], [3975, 3984, "AIRPLANE"], [4270, 4278, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4283, 4288, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4293, 4299, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4329, 4335, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4343, 4347, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4354, 4361, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["After pushing back we received taxi clearance to taxi to Runway XX. Originally ground had asked us if we could do a 180 degree turn and taxi south on Alpha. After determining there was not enough room to do the turn Ground instructed us to taxi to Runway XX via A; G; and we would back taxi down Runway XY to get into position. Ground informed us that runway condition levels were 3-3-3. We began taxiing and went at a normal safe taxi speed.After turning onto Taxiway G there is a kink in the taxiway. We made the first part of kink and as the Captain began to turn the aircraft back to the left I noticed we were a little to the right of center line. My feet were just off the rudder pedals in a guarding position. I reached up to put my feet on the pedals and could tell the Captain had already made a full deflection as the aircraft was now sliding in a 90 degree sliding turn. As the plane kept spinning it was sliding toward the grass that was to the left side of the taxiway. The CA applied thrust reverse to bring the plane to a stop. The plane never left the paved surface. Where we ended up we determined we could not safely taxi. We checked with the FAs and informed them we were going to be towed; most likely; back to the gate. The CA and I determined we should just be towed back to the gate. As the CA called ops to request the tug; I made a PA letting the passengers know what was happening and we would be going back to the gate to ensure the safety of the aircraft. We were towed back to the gate without further incident.\nThe weather was 9 miles visibility and light snow. The runway conditions was reported as 3-3-5. Some taxiways were closed due to icy conditions and the taxiway had wisps of snow but looked okay with 2 inches of snow on the side. We deiced and started to taxi. We started both engines and taxied at a slow speed.Halfway to the runway there was a slight jog to the right then left. I steered right then started to steer left but the aircraft kept going right. I stepped on the brakes and full left rudder but no effect. I then gave right engine thrust which started the aircraft turning left but also moving forward and left drift with the aircraft starting to do a 180 degree turn. I put the engine to idle. I knew the aircraft was sliding and thought of the actions of a car in a skid and thought of letting go of the brakes (not sure if I did). The aircraft was now sliding towards the left side of the taxiway and used thrust reverser to try to stop the further skid and the aircraft stopped just short of exiting the taxiway.The F/O recommended we have the aircraft towed back and we also had the aircraft inspected for damage which they found deep cuts in 4 tires which I believe was unrelated to the slide. When the tug came to tow us we saw the driver get out of the tug and he was sliding toward the aircraft over the clear ice.

We started taxiing with a hold short clearance and completed the before takeoff checklist to the line but were then given a runway change to 10R along with new taxi instructions and a second hold short clearance. I updated the FMS and I allowed myself to be distracted and forgot to inform the Captain that the new runway required us to change our flap setting. We were told to expect a XA08L departure but immediately after starting the second engine we were given an early position and hold clearance with traffic on final. We completed the before takeoff checklist without repeating the items above the line. We completed a normal takeoff and climb and I only noticed my error when we retracted the flaps. Vls came up faster than normal so I lowered the pitch to ensure we would continue to accelerate. The rest of the climb was uneventful.My biggest error was not asking for more time when I felt rushed to be ready for a position and hold. Other errors were not resetting flap in accordance with the takeoff date for our new runway and not repeating the entire before takeoff checklist.", {"entities": [[37, 44, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [53, 59, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [72, 85, "CREW"], [181, 189, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [274, 281, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [335, 342, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [387, 393, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [490, 493, "ABBREVIATION"], [557, 564, "CREW"], [578, 584, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [611, 615, "AIRPLANE"], [708, 714, "AIRPLANE"], [813, 820, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [897, 904, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [909, 914, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1085, 1090, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1240, 1244, "AIRPLANE"], [1268, 1275, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1293, 1299, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1336, 1343, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["Prior to boarding; I contacted Dispatch and discussed possible delays due to impending weather at the departure airport. I was aware that we would be waiting on the ground for weather to pass at the departure airport but we both expected that to quickly move through. Although the weather moved through quickly; once we taxied in line at approximately number 16; we were advised of 30 miles in trail for departures; meaning we would incur a significant delay. As we waited in line; the First Officer and I discussed the fuel and reviewed the weather enroute while also being aware of potential delay concerns. We also reviewed the weather forecast again and still noted that; should it become an issue; the alternate that was filed was not required and could be removed if necessary. I also sent an ACARs to Dispatch to verify that removing the alternate was an option and asked for them to review any changes so I could be aware as to whether or not removing the alternate was one way to manage the available fuel for planning purposes.After a taxi out time of approximately 1hr 30 minutes; we were number 1 for departure and verified that the fuel was above Min. Takeoff for departure. We had approximately 800 lbs. above what was required for Min. Takeoff. Just as we expected a takeoff clearance; Tower then informed us of a ground stop and had no idea how long it would last. We shut down both engines immediately to conserve the fuel for a quick restart and subsequent takeoff. With both engines shut down; the parking brake set; I spoke with the lead Flight Attendant to inform them of the ground stop and we coordinated that they would do a LOB delay service as well as give people an opportunity to use the restroom if necessary. I then called Dispatch to coordinate with them. We discussed the ATC issue; possible length of the delay; fuel state and the option to remove the alternate to fuel planning. I opted to keep the alternate on the paperwork only because; since we had the required fuel but still didn't know the time remaining on the delay; I didn't want to start with multiple changes to flight plan at this point so that we didn't create more work for us than necessary just yet. I also didn't want to have to change it back again if the weather deteriorated for some reason. While I was speaking with Dispatch and just after the ground stop was issued; the First Officer said they just lifted the ground stop and we're number one for takeoff. I remember noting the fuel at approximately 23.2 and the First Officer started both engines while I coordinated to ensure the passengers were seated and informed the Flight Attendants to stop their service for an immediate departure. The checklists were completed and I had one or two more calls to the Flight Attendant to ensure that the passengers and Flight Attendants were safely seated. We were cleared to 'Line up and Wait' and I noted the fuel at 22.8; above our Min. Takeoff of 22.6. After taxiing into position; we stopped for ATC to get spacing or traffic to clear but then we were cleared for takeoff.After climbing through 10;000 ft.; I requested the [Dispatch report] and started my review of that as we passed the first few fixes. I noticed that the fuel on takeoff on the [report] said 21.8; which immediately caught my attention because it was below the Min. Takeoff I was watching on the ground. I was surprised to see 21.8 on the [report] and immediately ACARS Dispatch and asked them to remove the alternate since the weather at the destination did not require it. They removed the alternate and sent me Release 2; which had a Planned Gate Fuel of 18.8 and a Min. Takeoff 17.5. This ensured our updated plan allowed us plenty of fuel for regulatory requirements and extra for altitude flex and turbulence mitigation. I informed the First Officer that the [report] showed we took off with 21.8 and we debriefed the error. Since I believe the [report] snapshot is taken at thrust lever application; I believe the error was mine. I'm certain that neither of us would have taken off if we saw that we were below 22.6; especially since we discussed it. I can only think that; in the moment and with my concerns being divided between the aircraft; flight attendants; passengers; and impending takeoff; I must have misread the 21.8 as 22.8 when we started the takeoff. As soon as I realized I must have made a mistake; I remedied the paperwork with Dispatch and immediately ensured that we could safely and legally continue to our destination. Once we removed the alternate and ensure we were safe and legal to continue; we continued and landed safely at our destination.", {"entities": [[87, 94, "WEATHER"], [176, 183, "WEATHER"], [281, 288, "WEATHER"], [542, 549, "WEATHER"], [631, 638, "WEATHER"], [2259, 2266, "WEATHER"], [3502, 3509, "WEATHER"], [3778, 3788, "WEATHER"], [31, 39, "CREW"], [320, 326, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [486, 499, "CREW"], [808, 816, "CREW"], [1165, 1172, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1251, 1258, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1282, 1289, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1301, 1306, "CREW"], [1475, 1482, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1753, 1761, "CREW"], [1804, 1807, "CREW"], [2323, 2331, "CREW"], [2379, 2392, "CREW"], [2456, 2463, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2522, 2535, "CREW"], [2940, 2947, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2963, 2970, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3001, 3004, "CREW"], [3069, 3076, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3083, 3091, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3100, 3109, "ALTITUDE"], [3129, 3137, "CREW"], [3237, 3244, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3340, 3347, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3438, 3443, "AIRPLANE"], [3444, 3452, "CREW"], [3648, 3655, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3816, 3829, "CREW"], [3858, 3866, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3955, 3967, "AIRPLANE"], [4053, 4062, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4226, 4243, "CREW"], [4271, 4278, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4337, 4344, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4426, 4434, "CREW"], [4615, 4621, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

Both engines were shut down at the time of aircraft movement.  Movement was immediately after shutdown of Number 2 engine.  This was evident to me because the nose tiller turned 180 degrees right after Number 2 engine shutdown which at the time I assumed was some kind of mechanical malfunction.  After I was briefed by the mechanic [I] realized that it was caused by aircraft movement.  This baffled me because I didn't understand why.  When I got home I reread our shutdown procedures.

	["During our flight to CLE; we were at 16;000 feet on the BRWNZ2 STAR; the autopilot was engaged. We were given a descent clearance to 10;000 feet by Cleveland Center; the exact location is unknown. No 'Descend Via' was issued. We were instructed to contact Cleveland Approach; and did so successfully with the current ATIS. Our altitude was 10;000 feet; speed was approximately 300 KIAS. Some time later (the exact location is unknown) the approach controller issued a clearance to descend and maintain 6;000 feet. After slowing to 250 KIAS; a descent at a rate of 1;500 FPM was initiated. After consulting the VNAV page on the FMS the rate was increased to 1;800 FPM based on the rate to comply with the anticipated crossing restriction at LLROY of 5;000 feet and 210 KIAS. A short time later in the vicinity of TRRKY intersection we were 'cleared for the ILS 24R after LLROY'. A short discussion was had by me and the First Officer if we could descend below 6;000 feet (our last assigned altitude). I noted that the approach chart notes for the 24R ILS read 'mandatory 5000' and 'max 210 kts.'; and we were on the arrival/approach so we could/should descend. This delayed our descent; and I used the speed brakes; and commanded flaps 9. During the descent we attempted to reprogram the FMS to eliminate the vector after LLROY. We crossed LRROY at 5;000 feet and 210 KIAS; but we had not successfully configured the FMS. The airplane started a turn towards a 056 heading. I disconnected the autopilot; and turned the aircraft towards the BORNY intersection using the MFD navigation display. The First Officer was able to correctly program the FMS; and the Flight Director indicated a turn to BORNY. I asked the First Officer to select 4;000 feet in the altitude selector. He hesitated; and we again discussed if we could descend. He selected 4;000 feet; and we continued the descent. I acquired the runway visual; and asked the First Officer to change my navigation source to conventional; and to arm the APPROACH mode. We captured the localizer and glideslope; configured and executed a stabilized approach. We were never queried by ATC about our altitudes; speeds; or courses. I believe no deviations occurred.During the STAR portion no 'descend via' was issued; so the 280 KIAS speeds were not used; we were unfamiliar with the approach; and did not anticipate joining the approach at LLROY. The last altitude given was 6;000 feet which caused confusion. We did not have enough time to correctly reconfigure the FMS.I believe if at some point we had been advised to 'expect the ILS 24R after LLROY;' or words to that effect; we could have ensured that the FMS and aircraft were properly configured. It's unclear when to descend since the notes (#3) advised to 'maintain last assigned altitude until established on glideslope'; but the note for LLROY has 'Mandatory 5;000.'", {"entities": [[37, 48, "ALTITUDE"], [63, 67, "ABBREVIATION"], [73, 82, "AIRPLANE"], [112, 119, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [133, 144, "ALTITUDE"], [266, 274, "CREW"], [317, 321, "ABBREVIATION"], [340, 351, "ALTITUDE"], [439, 447, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [481, 488, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [502, 512, "ALTITUDE"], [543, 550, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [570, 573, "ABBREVIATION"], [610, 614, "ABBREVIATION"], [627, 630, "ABBREVIATION"], [663, 666, "ABBREVIATION"], [749, 759, "ALTITUDE"], [818, 830, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [856, 859, "ABBREVIATION"], [919, 932, "CREW"], [945, 952, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [959, 969, "ALTITUDE"], [1017, 1025, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1050, 1053, "ABBREVIATION"], [1089, 1092, "ABBREVIATION"], [1123, 1131, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1151, 1158, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1177, 1184, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1249, 1256, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1287, 1290, "ABBREVIATION"], [1348, 1358, "ALTITUDE"], [1416, 1419, "ABBREVIATION"], [1491, 1500, "AIRPLANE"], [1544, 1556, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1595, 1608, "CREW"], [1643, 1646, "ABBREVIATION"], [1711, 1724, "CREW"], [1735, 1745, "ALTITUDE"], [1821, 1828, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1842, 1852, "ALTITUDE"], [1875, 1882, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1899, 1905, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1928, 1941, "CREW"], [2005, 2013, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2099, 2107, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2134, 2137, "CREW"], [2223, 2227, "ABBREVIATION"], [2331, 2339, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2376, 2384, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2423, 2433, "ALTITUDE"], [2581, 2584, "ABBREVIATION"], [2659, 2662, "ABBREVIATION"], [2723, 2730, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

After about 5 minutes of communicating with the FAs on the condition of the FO they informed me he was up; doing well; and had his color back to normal. I spoke with the FO over the inter-phone system and he explained he was feeling much better and believed he was ok to continue.

	["Everything was normal until [the] takeoff phase of the flight. It was a snowy day which required de-icing. We completed all the checklists and procedures for takeoff. We were cleared for takeoff. The Captain was the pilot flying and he applied T/O thrust. We accelerated normally and became airborne. About 10 seconds after retracting the gear; 'BRAKE OVHT (Overheat)' warning message displayed on EICAS and BTMS (Brake Temperature Monitoring System) red for Right Inboard. I called it and the Captain then said 'I have the radios; BRAKE OVHT emergency checklist.' The checklist led us to the QRH and QRH instructed us to lower the landing gear. After lowering the landing gear the temperature decreased all the way to within the specified green range. Then the QRH led us to put the gear back up and continue flight if no further indications occurred. However; when we retracted the gear again; the same BTMS temperature started increasing rapidly. The Captain called gear down; and I put the gear down and this action brought the temperature down again. At that point the Captain advised ATC due to possible fire and we leveled off at 5;000 feet. When we ran the QRH again the QRH led us to 'land nearest suitable airport.' We advised ATC that we needed about 15 minutes and vectors to stay close to the airport and completed After Takeoff checklist. The Captain transferred the flight controls to me and communicated with flight attendants for potential fire and Dispatch. In the meantime I loaded FMS and then briefed the approach to be flown. Then the Captain took the controls back; we ran the descent and Approach checklists. Initiated the approach and came to a complete stop on the runway after a fairly smooth landing and completing After Landing Shutdown checks; we requested ARFF (Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting). After fire rescue verified there was no indication of fire we requested to be towed to the gate and be escorted by fire rescue. We completed the flight safely at the gate and Maintenance personnel met us at the aircraft.The Mechanic told us that it was a BTMS sensor malfunction.\nWe received a BRAKE OVHT warning message soon after take off once the landing gear was fully retracted. I was the pilot flying and and we waited until 1;000 feet and I asked the FO to run the Emergency Checklist for BRAKE OVHT; and took over the radios. Once we completed the QRH including the notes in the QRH we were not 100% sure if this was a sensor error as it did not meet the criteria described in the QRH note. As a result we completed the QRH and this resulted in the QRH telling us to land at the nearest suitable airport. At that point in time ZZZZ was the nearest suitable airport. Additionally I suspected a heat source somewhere near the landing gear since the indication only came on every time the gear was up. We read through the checklist one more time to make sure we did not miss anything. After that we advised ATC and asked for delayed vectors to keep us close to the airport. I had a conversation with my FO to make a plan of action. I then gave him the flight controls so that I could loop the Dispatcher. I also had asked the FA to prepare for a red level incident and keep a look out for smoke or fumes near the middle of the cabin. I explained the situation and told them that I cannot be 100% sure if it is the sensor which is malfunctioning or if there is something else that's causing the Brake OVHT. I knew in the back of my mind that it had to be a bad sensor since we had just taken off from a snow covered airport; at the same time the other symptoms suggested that it may be something else which the QRH may not have accounted for. We made the decision to land based on this and also QRH. Everything was done in about 10 minutes and we were ready for an intentional overweight landing. I briefed the FO that during touch down I will be reducing my Vertical rate of descent to below 200 FPM; so we don't break apart. We also briefed and coordinated with the fire trucks that we will use minimum braking and stop near the end of the runway. The fire command chief got on the radio and inspected the aircraft after we landed and shut down our engines. We were given the all clear of no fire or hot brakes. We then contacted the company to get permission to be towed to the gate. Ops sent out a tug and we were taken to [the] gate in ZZZZ. A firetruck followed us. Once we got to the gate and we inspected the aircraft further and I thanked the fire chief for helping out. We proceeded with Maintenance; Dispatch and Fleet Manager's guidance from that point on.The mechanic advised us that it could be faulty sensors/wiring or the BTMS itself could be faulty.", {"entities": [[100, 105, "WEATHER"], [682, 693, "WEATHER"], [910, 921, "WEATHER"], [1032, 1043, "WEATHER"], [3223, 3228, "WEATHER"], [3536, 3540, "WEATHER"], [34, 41, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [158, 165, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [187, 194, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [200, 207, "CREW"], [216, 221, "CREW"], [398, 403, "AIRPLANE"], [494, 501, "CREW"], [593, 596, "ABBREVIATION"], [601, 604, "ABBREVIATION"], [632, 644, "AIRPLANE"], [665, 677, "AIRPLANE"], [762, 765, "ABBREVIATION"], [954, 961, "CREW"], [1074, 1081, "CREW"], [1090, 1093, "CREW"], [1137, 1147, "ALTITUDE"], [1165, 1168, "ABBREVIATION"], [1179, 1182, "ABBREVIATION"], [1194, 1198, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1237, 1240, "CREW"], [1357, 1364, "CREW"], [1425, 1442, "CREW"], [1466, 1474, "CREW"], [1501, 1504, "ABBREVIATION"], [1526, 1534, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1541, 1546, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1557, 1564, "CREW"], [1600, 1607, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1612, 1620, "CREW"], [1647, 1655, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1691, 1697, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1920, 1924, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1995, 1999, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2004, 2015, "CREW"], [2053, 2061, "CREW"], [2161, 2169, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2179, 2191, "AIRPLANE"], [2223, 2228, "CREW"], [2260, 2270, "ALTITUDE"], [2287, 2289, "ABBREVIATION"], [2385, 2388, "ABBREVIATION"], [2416, 2419, "ABBREVIATION"], [2518, 2521, "ABBREVIATION"], [2557, 2560, "ABBREVIATION"], [2586, 2589, "ABBREVIATION"], [2604, 2608, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2761, 2773, "AIRPLANE"], [2941, 2944, "CREW"], [3037, 3039, "ABBREVIATION"], [3261, 3266, "AIRPLANE"], [3519, 3528, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3644, 3647, "ABBREVIATION"], [3700, 3704, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3728, 3731, "ABBREVIATION"], [3844, 3846, "ABBREVIATION"], [3909, 3916, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3930, 3933, "ABBREVIATION"], [4075, 4081, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4117, 4122, "AIRPLANE"], [4159, 4165, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4314, 4318, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4366, 4370, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4424, 4428, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4531, 4542, "CREW"], [4544, 4552, "CREW"]]}],

Flight deck has oxygen source available for both pilots. Flight Attendant has POB sources for use in the cabin aside from the oxygen source in oxygen masks that are deployed during a decompression. Passengers have no oxygen source other than oxygen masks that are deployed during a decompression. In this incident; the flight for passengers was deemed unsafe; yet the Flight Attendant was scheduled by the scheduling department to deadhead on a 'ferry flight.' If it was deemed unsafe for passengers; it should subsequently be deemed unsafe for cabin crew. Proper procedures for fumes/odor in the cabin would have prevented. Proper filtration system on aircraft would prevent fumes/odor in cabin thereby preventing exposure to toxic air in the cabin for both employees and passengers. Continuous exposure to toxicities present in fumes/odor in the cabin has the potential of producing long term side effects up to and including chronic and fatal injuries.Establish procedures for flight attendants for exposure to fumes in the cabin. (E.g. don oxygen from POB or other oxygen source). Establish procedures and protocol for medical examination for workplace toxicity hazards due to fume/odor exposure in cabin.

	["Upon landing at ZZZ on Runway XXR to complete a round-robin VFR flight to ZZZ1; on the rollout as I was almost slowed enough to make the turnoff to Taxiway X; I experienced a violent vibration in what seemed to be the nose gear. At the time I had the yoke pulled full back to relieve braking pressure on the nose gear and was applying braking force. When the shimmy occurred; I eased the braking force to try to minimize the shimmy. However; in doing so; I was unable to make the turn onto the exit taxiway.At the time; I was aware that there was another plane on approach to landing behind me on Runway XXR. Not certain exactly what was causing the vibration and realizing that the next available turnoff was a good distance away; my instinct was to clear the runway immediately to clear the way for approaching landing traffic.So I pulled off the runway into the grassy area and came to a stop between the runway and Taxiway Y just past exit Taxiway X. ZZZ Tower ATC advised [me] to stay where I was and that the emergency equipment was on the way. I had not declared an emergency.On inspection; we could not immediately determine the cause of the vibration because the nose gear was embedded up to the fairings in soft mud under the grass caused by recent rains in the area. That was not visually apparent until stepping onto the grass.The emergency truck arrived and determined there were no injuries to me or to my single passenger. The runway was closed to traffic pending removal of my airplane from the runway environment.The Tower contacted my landlord FBO to send a tow. The tow got instantly stuck in the mud; requiring a second tow to pull it out. The emergency crew then contacted the ZZZ Airport Manager's office; which in turn contacted an outside towing company with experience in towing aircraft.The outside tow truck was delayed for an estimated two hours due to being stuck in traffic from a football game; which had ended almost precisely as the time of this landing. He eventually arrived and towed the plane to the runway surface; where the FBO tow took over and towed the airplane to the hangar. On inspection; the cause of the violent shimmy was a blown tire on the nose gear.There was no damage to the plane nor to any airport ground equipment/structures; and there were no injuries involved.I made a split-second decision to pull off the runway into the grass believing that the safest recourse in the situation was to remove my aircraft from being a hazard on the runway.", {"entities": [[292, 300, "WEATHER"], [5, 12, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [60, 63, "ABBREVIATION"], [218, 222, "AIRPLANE"], [251, 255, "AIRPLANE"], [308, 312, "AIRPLANE"], [499, 506, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [564, 572, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [576, 583, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [761, 767, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [801, 812, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [849, 855, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [908, 914, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [959, 964, "CREW"], [965, 968, "CREW"], [1172, 1176, "AIRPLANE"], [1236, 1241, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1333, 1338, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1359, 1366, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1442, 1448, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1511, 1517, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1534, 1539, "CREW"], [1562, 1565, "ABBREVIATION"], [2002, 2009, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2037, 2043, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2063, 2066, "ABBREVIATION"], [2111, 2117, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2190, 2194, "AIRPLANE"], [2364, 2370, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2380, 2385, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2491, 2497, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

	["On our arrival into SJC at approximately XA:40PM with FO flying; NorCal approach cleared us down to 5;100 feet flying over low; unlit mountainous terrain just east of coast. With VMC conditions prevailing; NorCal asked if we would like a visual approach. With the airport in sight; the FO indicated yes he would. The aircraft (Nav Radios and FMC) was set up for the ILS 30L approach for back up guidance and had been appropriately briefed. We set 2;700 feet in the altitude alerter window for the crossing restriction at HIVAK (GS Intercept) intersection as back up. The FO asked for a Leg Intercept to HIVAK. While I was head down executing Leg Intercept and then looking at IPad to confirm Tower Frequency and tune radios; the FO had smoothly initiated a Vertical Speed descent that I did not notice or feel in the seat of the pants. A Terrain GPWS Alert got my full attention. With a delayed response in the right seat; I took control of the aircraft and immediately executed an escape maneuver to ascend free of terrain. When well clear of terrain; configured aircraft; reestablished stable approach; and made uneventful landing.Especially in critical phases of flight (below 10;000 and sterile); great example of the need for communication Between Pilot Monitoring and Pilot Flying.I've done this arrival countless times and am very familiar. In the Debrief I learned the FO was not familiar. Although I had brought up the terrain and how dark it was to the FO as we approached; I could have been briefed up better. Additionally; I do believe NorCal kind of baited Pilot Flying with a Visual Approach Clearance at night while still over unlit terrain.In the future; especially at night; the RNAV Z to 30L would have been a much better option and prudent.\nDuring our initial descent into SJC; we received a GPWS alert followed by a warning. The recovery was initiated immediately by the Captain (PM). He followed the correct procedure and complied with this warning. We then exchanged controls and the rest of the approach was uneventful. I was the pilot flying. During the descent into SJC; we were cleared to descend to 5;100 feet. It was very dark and it was hard to see the surrounding mountains. I checked my VSD as well as the highest peak in the area and clearance was showing at 4;100 feet. Due to the long day and night flying; I was more comfortable doing the ILS 30L into SJC with vectors to final. However; we agreed on accepting a visual approach. We began the downwind leg as well as a gradual descent from 5;100 feet to be at the final approach fix at 2;700 feet. Upon beginning the descent in vertical speed; we received a GPWS alert for terrain ahead. I immediately disconnected the autopilot and leveled off the aircraft. Within a few seconds; we received a GPWS warning to pull up. The Captain took over the controls; recovered promptly and after climbing back up to roughly 5;000 feet; he initiated the descent back into SJC. We exchanged controls and I completed the approach and landed uneventfully.Whenever flying at night surrounded by terrain; I will insist in requesting an ILS or RNP approach to provide an additional margin of safety and protection from the surrounding terrain. I will also do a better job at communicating with my Captain that we have initiated a descent and to verify that what I'm doing looks correct; but most importantly; safe. The next time I hear a GWPS alert; I will respond more proactively and will initiate a climb more promptly without hesitation.", {"entities": [[54, 56, "ABBREVIATION"], [57, 63, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [72, 80, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [100, 110, "ALTITUDE"], [111, 117, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [238, 253, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [286, 288, "ABBREVIATION"], [366, 369, "ABBREVIATION"], [374, 382, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [447, 457, "ALTITUDE"], [482, 488, "AIRPLANE"], [528, 530, "ABBREVIATION"], [542, 554, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [571, 573, "ABBREVIATION"], [692, 697, "CREW"], [729, 731, "ABBREVIATION"], [772, 779, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [817, 821, "AIRPLANE"], [917, 921, "AIRPLANE"], [1095, 1103, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1377, 1379, "ABBREVIATION"], [1463, 1465, "ABBREVIATION"], [1472, 1482, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1576, 1582, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1597, 1605, "CREW"], [1696, 1700, "ABBREVIATION"], [1779, 1786, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1891, 1898, "CREW"], [2018, 2026, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2053, 2058, "CREW"], [2059, 2065, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2078, 2085, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2115, 2122, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2126, 2136, "ALTITUDE"], [2291, 2301, "ALTITUDE"], [2333, 2339, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2374, 2377, "ABBREVIATION"], [2448, 2463, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2478, 2490, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2512, 2519, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2525, 2535, "ALTITUDE"], [2549, 2563, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2571, 2581, "ALTITUDE"], [2602, 2609, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2704, 2713, "AIRPLANE"], [2809, 2816, "CREW"], [2870, 2878, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2898, 2908, "ALTITUDE"], [2927, 2934, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2992, 3000, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3005, 3011, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3034, 3040, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3104, 3107, "ABBREVIATION"], [3115, 3123, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3264, 3271, "CREW"], [3297, 3304, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3469, 3474, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

The Captain turned on the internal air and Jet Fumes 'Fuel Gases' came into the airplane. So strong; that the Flight Attendant Number 4 went up to the cockpit and told him to turn off the air. Passengers then deplaned and Maintenance arrived. They pulled out F/C galley carts and walked throughout the plane. They said; that they didn't smell anything. But; we 'the crew' could still get whiffs of the smell. The FAA Inspector seated in XC (he boarded before passengers); also walked through and could smell it. The Maintenance (Representative) proceeded to write it 'all clear' in the log book and we 'the flight attendants' said wait! We are calling Management and the Union. We had a FSM and The Operational Manager come to the plane. Upon entering they smelled it immediately and asked us to step onto the jetbridge. Maintenance then proceeded to re-check the plane and the FAA Inspector followed behind. As we the crew were on the jetbridge; the maintenance crew closed the aircraft door and started the APU.

The last thing the pilot heard was Aircraft Y reporting hearing the transmission to ZZZ Approach.The primary radio (a GNS430) turned off roughly 15 seconds later (which stopped the 'oh no' transmission); followed by the aircraft's transponder. The pilot determined the best course of action; at this point; was to remain on course. On the current flight path and altitude - there was no risk of violating airspace (either ZZZ1 Class B shelf or ZZZ Class C shelf); and Aircraft X was almost exactly between the nearest two towered airports (ZZZ and ZZZ2) so proceeding on a westerly course was deemed best.After maintaining aircraft control and understanding the situation; the pilot then attempted to follow the proper checklist for electronic failures. The pilot initially thought the issue was a full alternator failure; but before attempting the recommended troubleshooting; decided to check the circuit breaker panel - finding that the 60 amp alternator breaker had tripped. After toggling the master switch off; turning off light switches; and other electrical loads; the pilot then reset the breaker and brought master back online. From there; everything appeared normal. Radios were back online - however the transponder (GTX 355) reported 'fail' on screen and was presumably in-op. By this point; Aircraft X [was] within the ZZZ1 30 NM Mode C veil without a functioning Mode C transponder. The pilot then contacted ZZZ Approach to inform them that the 'oh no' transmission was actually Aircraft X and let them know of the situation. The transponder was offline for roughly the next three minutes as the aircraft continued its westbound course to the ZZZ2 area - at that point; the pilot decided to attempt to power cycle the transponder; after which it appeared to operate correctly.No emergency was ever declared. Aircraft X landed at ZZZ2 without incident at XB:17.", {"entities": [[158, 169, "AIRPLANE"], [216, 219, "ABBREVIATION"], [504, 509, "CREW"], [598, 603, "CREW"], [825, 830, "CREW"], [1017, 1022, "CREW"], [1086, 1094, "CREW"], [1107, 1112, "AIRPLANE"], [1229, 1240, "AIRPLANE"], [1246, 1251, "CREW"], [1675, 1680, "CREW"], [1756, 1761, "CREW"], [2075, 2080, "CREW"], [2214, 2225, "AIRPLANE"], [2339, 2341, "ABBREVIATION"], [2383, 2394, "AIRPLANE"], [2400, 2405, "CREW"], [2425, 2433, "CREW"], [2543, 2554, "AIRPLANE"], [2687, 2692, "CREW"], [2731, 2742, "AIRPLANE"], [2832, 2838, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["We had to find a route to get through the line of weather; on our second ATC assigned route; we made it through the weather somewhat easily. Handed off to Ft. Myers Approach. The current ATIS; Q; showed winds 180-7; 10 VIS; 800 Few; Temp/ Dew Point 23/23; 30.08. RSW VOR was out of service. Runway 24 was in use. I told the First Officer to 'Let Approach know we could NOT do the RNAV Runway 24 GPS Approach.' He notified Approach of this. Approach told us to expect the VOR Runway 24 Approach. We reminded Approach the VOR was out of service. Approach forgot. He said he would vector us for the Visual Approach since it was 1500 Few at that time. As we got closer; I told the First Officer; 'That sure is a pretty THICK Few clouds.' It was broken clouds at best; almost overcast. We asked what aircraft were breaking out on the approach. Approach said they would ask (other carrier). They never got back with us on that. We were vectored on a tight left base for Runway 24 at 150 ft.'. You could see many layers of broken clouds; easily 300 to 400 ft. below us at 1500 ft.; no ground contact. We told Approach. Approach had us climb back up to be vectored for left downwind for ILS Runway 24. Approach asked us; 'Winds were around 200 at 7 knots. Can you accept that?' We said; 'YES.' Later; we were cleared to intercept the LOC Runway 24. We did. Coming tight on LOC Runway 24 at TROPC; no clearance. We asked for a clearance three times coming up to and ON top of TROPC; and finally got a clearance from Approach Control. We were descending on the ILS Ruway 6 Approach. I noticed the winds on the EFIS was a 30-knot tailwind! I told this to the First Officer. Then I told the First Officer; the winds must die out close to the airport. Soon after; Approach told us the winds are now '220 at 18 gusting 24!' I told the First Officer; we have to miss approach and go to our alternate. First Officer told Approach and they vectored us for missed approach; and handed us over to Miami Center (if I remember right.) Told them we 'Want to go to our ZZZ; which is our alternate.' Sent a message to Dispatch. Dispatch responded and said we needed to go to ZZZ1 for an alternate; since of the TFR coming into effect at ZZZ.We went uneventfully to ZZZ1; to a long taxi in at ZZZ1. Found out our Maintenance at ZZZ1 had the replacement part for the MEL there; and they replaced the part. Maintenance signed off the logbook and off we went to RSW; with another very long taxi out. I was told by Dispatch to talk to the Operations Center Chief Pilot. He was upset why we diverted; with weather 1500 Few. He wanted to know why we did not circle to land. I told him what the weather really was. He seemed more understanding. He said; do an [Report]. I said; we did not do anything wrong. He said; so maybe this MEL 34-XX-XX will be studied out more for future flights; or something like that.\nReport requested from Chief Pilot; Two missed approaches followed by a diversion to ZZZ1. En route from ZZZ2 to RSW we had to pass through a front that was crossing the state old FL. The aircraft had the GPWS on MEL which prevented us from flying a RNAV Approach. Weather in RSW at departure time did not indicate that we would need to fly an approach to get in. Runway in use at RSW was Runway 24. The two approaches they had were RNAV and VOR. VOR was [Out of Service]. Weather via ACARS was 1500 ft. scattered with ten mile visibility or somewhere close to that. On contact with RSW Approach we told them we were unable the RNAV. They told us that we should be able to get in with the visual. Descended down to 1500 ft. and turn base. The cloud cover prevented us from getting into the airport visually. Went missed and were told to expect the ILS Runway 6. Winds were reported 220/7. Came in for the ILS and upon contacting Tower we were told the winds were 220/17G29. This exceeded the tailwind for the Aircraft. Went missed and diverted to ZZZ1.

	["I was completing the last round trip of six days of flying. My Flight Attendant had a maintenance item that was concerning and put a hold on boarding. Now I had ticket agents; ground agents and Operations all hounding me to board. I had to call the maintenance item in and wait for someone to come out for that. My workload and task saturation was severely increased at this point. When it came time to do my job finally; we were able to complete our tasks after numerous interruptions. I did look over the entire release; weather and NOTAMs reviewing them with the First Officer. When we arrived at our destination the agent told me the runway was closed and we needed to see how many passengers we could take.

I went back over the release and saw where the closer was buried in the end of the NOTAMs. I saw all the other information for the runway but missed the obvious. I noticed that we were planned by the Dispatcher to land on that closed runway and did not catch it until after we had landed.The pressure and constant interruption from all the agents caused me to overlook something I normally would find. I did read the NOTAMs; but for some reason did not see where it said the runway was closed. This is why I checked off the arrival runway on the release thinking we were originally planned to land on a runway that was opened at the time of our arrival. I did not plan or intend to make this oversight; but simply let the distractions overcome me from seeing this clearly. The constant distractions and pressure the company puts on us to make turns or meet their metrics is becoming a problem that is trading safety for meeting metrics. It makes it harder for me to do my job safely when there is more than one person constantly putting pressure on you to make the aircraft move at all cost.

It seems like they have not been trained to include this in their brief or I don't even know if they even are trained to look at them. This is something I have been noticing since the transition.

They were taken aback by my question and told me they didn't know. Then; they said they don't even know if their headsets were functioning. I then explained that we needed to configure the aircraft before de-icing; shut down the APU and needed to do a checklist also. So I suggested that we would flash the taxi light at them as a signal when we would be ready to start the de-icing procedure.Our passenger arrived shortly after that; and we briefed them also about the fact that we were going to be de-iced. We then started our checklist; and we were only at the second step or so when the First Officer noticed the de-icing truck out of the corner of his eye. They then started spraying the right wing. No notice; nothing. The First Officer quickly shut down the APU and I hurried out of my seat to open the aircraft door to get outside. It looked like we were quick enough with the APU shutdown and no fluid had entered the exhaust. Once outside I walked over to the truck and asked why they started spraying without waiting on our all clear sign. I got no clear answer. I went back inside the aircraft and they finished the de-icing. Since I now did not trust their work method; I went back outside to do a tactical check. The driver of the truck then also walked up to me and I asked him again what happened between our conversation inside the FBO and not 30 minutes later they did not adhere to anything I said. He replied that it was hard to hear our APU noise over the noise of the de-ice truck. That is no excuse; the whole idea was to wait on our signal to start the deicing process.I do not know what else I could have done to have prevented this. I thought I was very clear upfront with our request for Type I; and I thought I was also very clear in explaining that we needed time to be configured and to finish our checklist. And more importantly; we talked about a light signal in leu of transmitting  on a frequency. I am very surprised that an FBO in a place like ZZZ does not have better trained de-icing personnel. This is a place where surely they need to de-ice often; and their personnel should have a lot of experience with de-icing procedures. What we witnessed yesterday was very unprofessional.", {"entities": [[143, 148, "WEATHER"], [326, 331, "WEATHER"], [746, 751, "WEATHER"], [915, 920, "WEATHER"], [1158, 1163, "WEATHER"], [1195, 1198, "WEATHER"], [1669, 1674, "WEATHER"], [2554, 2559, "WEATHER"], [2687, 2692, "WEATHER"], [207, 213, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [265, 278, "CREW"], [398, 401, "ABBREVIATION"], [528, 531, "ABBREVIATION"], [767, 770, "AIRPLANE"], [845, 855, "AIRPLANE"], [945, 952, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1129, 1142, "CREW"], [1237, 1241, "AIRPLANE"], [1267, 1280, "CREW"], [1303, 1306, "AIRPLANE"], [1331, 1335, "AIRPLANE"], [1357, 1361, "AIRPLANE"], [1423, 1426, "AIRPLANE"], [1887, 1890, "ABBREVIATION"], [1996, 1999, "AIRPLANE"], [2498, 2501, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

I spoke to the FAs again and I asked them if it had gotten better and they said yes; but that they said one of them still felt dizzy.

	["Approximately 1 hour into flight during food and beverage service the Captain made an all call and stated the right engine was over heating and we needed to turn back to ZZZ.  FAs stowed carts; secured the cabin; conducted 30 second review and assessed.  No emergency cabin prep required.  Captain made appropriate announcements for passengers including emergency personnel upon landing as to not alarm them of the visual presence.  Captain informed crew that company  management has encouraged the flight deck to continue on to ZZZ1 and disregard the over heating engine.  The landing was a heavy one due to fuel weight.  It was a nervous one but also uneventful.Once back in ZZZ the replacement aircraft we were given had an inoperative water system.  It had been shut off by maintenance.  Therefore; the company was sending a flight load of passengers that had already experienced a return to land on an additional 5.7 hour flight with NO workable water.There MUST be an FAA regulation (time or miles) as to how far a aircraft can operate with an inoperative water system.  It is HIGHLY unsanitary and unethical.  Human health and well-being must come before profit.\nThirty to forty minutes after takeoff; the Captain advised the cabin crew that the flight would be returning to ZZZ as a result of the #2 right engine overheating. The Captain advised that it would be a normal landing but as a precaution; emergency personnel would be on standby. Preparation for landing was normal and the cabin crew conducted their 30 second review of evacuation procedures in addition to mentally identifying able-bodied persons to assist in the event of an evacuation. The flight landed safely; and the Captain debriefed the crew after deplaning. Communication updates by both the Captain and I (as Lead FA) were given to passengers regarding the status of the flight; purpose for return; aircraft and gate changes.The flight was met by Flight Service manager; along with another manager(s) from Customer Service. The Flight was reassigned a new aircraft and a new flight deck crew.While waiting for the arrival of the new flight deck crew; the cabin crew was notified that the newly assigned aircraft would be flying to ZZZ1 without water; no water to wash hands; no water to flush toilets; no water to brew coffee.Cabin Service catered one case of extra bottled water; four extra bottles of soap; the entire surplus of towelettes they had in stock (which was enough towelettes to accommodate about twenty people). NOTE: Flying time to ZZZ1 was 5 hours and 7 minutes with a full flight.Soon after the cabin crew boarded the new aircraft and upon learning of the maintenance water issue; the newly reassigned Captain removed himself from the flight for reasons of fatigue. The First Officer still had not boarded. At XA:10 Crew Tracking was notified that the cabin crew would not be continuing.CONCERNS:My limited knowledge of aerodynamics and aircraft maintenance aside; I do have some serious concerns regarding judgment calls made by airline leadership from the events of the day.The first being that there had been an apparent request by company leadership to have the original aircraft continue onto ZZZ1 once the pilots had taken corrective action inflight.Another concern was the decision by company leadership to have a full aircraft of passengers and crew fly cross-country on an aircraft with no water and no working lavatories. Sanitary concerns being paramount once brought to our attention; my crew and I were unable to locate service policy and procedures relevant to this type of operational event.Then there was the deterioration of the customer trust in the company brand. On two separate occasions; I asked both the Customer Service Manager and the Lead Gate Agent to make announcements; specifically; about using the facilities before boarding the aircraft.As a courtesy and once the decision was made to release myself from duty; I stayed behind on the aircraft until the third assigned fight deck crew arrived in order to brief them of the events. Upon leaving the aircraft; I was barraged by concerned and scared passengers. This is understandable. What is not understandable is that everyone to whom I spoke stated that announcements made by gate agents were limited to rebookings on other flights. The events of the day culminated in a downward spiral of events; ultimately leading to the perception of a total disregard for safety and concern for both crew and customers. All confidence was lost; and I believed it would be unsafe to fly.", {"entities": [[70, 77, "CREW"], [116, 122, "AIRPLANE"], [206, 211, "AIRPLANE"], [268, 273, "AIRPLANE"], [290, 297, "CREW"], [379, 386, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [433, 440, "CREW"], [565, 571, "AIRPLANE"], [778, 789, "CREW"], [896, 900, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [974, 977, "ABBREVIATION"], [1200, 1207, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1213, 1220, "CREW"], [1233, 1243, "CREW"], [1314, 1320, "AIRPLANE"], [1338, 1345, "CREW"], [1493, 1503, "CREW"], [1670, 1676, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1693, 1700, "CREW"], [1771, 1778, "CREW"], [1892, 1896, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2135, 2145, "CREW"], [2201, 2207, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2512, 2518, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2592, 2602, "CREW"], [2653, 2664, "CREW"], [2699, 2706, "CREW"], [2767, 2780, "CREW"], [2849, 2859, "CREW"], [2943, 2954, "CREW"], [3209, 3215, "CREW"], [3355, 3358, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4013, 4020, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4255, 4259, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4549, 4552, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["I was assigned to perform a pushback for Flight XXX. Once the CA and FO completed their preflight checklist; they asked to have ground air removed from the aircraft; then we continued with running engine #2; followed by removing GPU; releasing brakes and pursuing the pushback. As a new hire mechanic for this was my third attempt at a pushback with a tug in tow. At this time in the morning; we had a mist followed by a period of light rain and calm winds. Inexperienced; I proceeded to pushback with my fellow A&P mechanic on my right hand side guiding me and giving me hand signals to guide the tug. I was instructed by him to let go of the brake from the tug and let the tug push without using any acceleration and use the accelerator if need be. At this point I approached an unmarked portion of the ramp providing the place where I should be turning the plane for taxiing. As I am proceeding to turn; I noticed and was instructed that there is no indication on the NLG (Nose Landing Gear) door to where the 91 degree mark is (beyond or exceeding the turning radius). At this point; once I turned I notice that I turned too hard going beyond the point taking into consideration that there is no indication anywhere specifying turning radius. Once I came to a complete stop; I notified the CA and FO to set the brakes; once the brakes were set; the rampers released the tow bar from the plane and I backed up about 3 feet and then the tow bar was placed on the tug; removed the safety pin; verified that the pin was removed with CA and FO; rampers removed the phone jack and closed the GPU panel. I then drove off to the gate and noticed that the shear pin was sheared off and the tow bar was bent. I then notified my supervisor. I inspected the NLG and found that the bobbins on both sides were fractured.

	["Today; it was brought to my attention that an aircraft had flown within 100 feet. Of terrain at night; during a shift that I worked earlier in the week. Although I had just accepted a handoff on the subject aircraft; I was not speaking to the aircraft at the time of the event. Here are some details. At night I took the handoff from the TRACON sector for Aircraft X. Immediately after accepting the handoff; I received a low altitude alert for that aircraft. I immediately transmitted 'Aircraft X; I called the TRACON sector shout line; to verify that they were still talking to the aircraft; and they answered in the affirmative.  Approximately two minutes later; Aircraft X checked in on my frequency; and I cleared them to land. Aircraft X landed and taxied to parking without further incident.This was obviously an unsafe situation; and I am submitting this report for that reason. I did notice; after making my transmission to the aircraft in the blind; and after making the land line communication; that the aircraft was below the MVA (Minimum Vectoring Altitude) at the time of the low altitude alert. I did not expect that the aircraft would have been on my frequency; because; as I recall; I had just taken the handoff immediately prior to the low altitude alert.

	["In ZZZZ; I joined the Captain for one leg; returning to ZZZ1 (I had deadheaded into ZZZZ). We had not previously met each other before this flight. Ride to the airport and flight planning were uneventful.Aircraft arrived an hour late in ZZZZ. During my initial preflight set up; I noticed a STATUS message for a valve in the Lower Lobe Crew Rest. The STATUS message was not on the MEL document I had downloaded and reviewed on my iPad. With Captain's concurrence; I called ZZZZ Maintenance to the airplane. Maintenance technicians arrived and said the valve was deferred (at that point I noticed a deferral sticker adjacent to the lower screen). We still did not have a Maintenance Release available (which would have shown the deferral number and the corresponding instructions/impact on the flight). I continued my duties and the Maintenance technicians went to the cabin. I was not privy to the discussion that ensued between Maintenance; the Captain; the relief pilots; and the purser.Focused on getting the jet ready as quickly and safely as possible; I was on the flight deck alone when the Captain stuck his head in and told me the Lower Lobe Crew Rest was inoperative due to the deferral. And then he asked if I was okay with the flight attendants sharing our bunk with us. As it violated SOP; I emphatically shook my head and mouthed the word 'no'; (so it would not be heard in the cabin). Quite frankly; I was very surprised the Captain asked the question and did so in such a public manner. A few minutes later; I was shocked to hear my fellow pilots helping our purser make up the lower bunk (as they discussed her inability to climb into the upper bunk while wearing a skirt). Having my input completely disregarded by the Captain was very upsetting and made concentrating on my procedures challenging. It had a significant negative impact on CRM for the remainder of the flight.Since the Captain had apparently volunteered to share the bunk with the flight attendants despite my input not to do so; I assumed the Captain would be using the upper bunk and I would be using the rest seat in the cabin for our break. I was wrong. Just before pushback; the Captain announced he would take his break in the rest seat. I was dumbfounded. Not wanting to negatively impact the already delayed full flight; I decided not to discuss the bunk issue at that time. Instead; I tried my best to focus on my Pilot Not Flying duties.Once established at cruise with the relief pilots on first break; I opened a discussion with the Captain by asking him what the plan was for second break. He said he is going in the seat. I asked the Captain if the bunk without flight attendants would be available for my rest; and he said he didn't know. I told him I did not agree with his decision to allow the flight attendants to use the pilot bunk. He said he knew I didn't and that I had made my position 'quite clear' when he asked me during preflight. I informed him I was using the rest seat or getting in the bunk alone. He said he prefers the seat; so that is where he is going. He then said he doesn't know the flight attendant rest schedule. I told him I was not involved in any discussion of flight attendants using the bunk; he was. I was amazed that the Captain was refusing to share the bunk room with the flight attendants himself; while at the same time trying to force me to do so. We sat in silence for a bit; until finally he told me I would have the bunk to myself. We then took a bathroom break. After the Captain returned to the flight deck; the Purser called me. She was very upset so I offered to put the Captain on the phone; but she refused my offer. She said she had already talked to the Captain when he came out. She stated she had to redo her break schedule as; without the pilot bunk; they have to do three breaks instead of two (because they only have four rest seats with ten flight attendants). Apparently; the Captain had made me the bad guy for trying to follow SOP. I told the Purser I was willing to take my rest in the seat to solve the problem; but the Captain refused to give me that option. After I hung up with the Purser; the Captain said he didn't realize how 'peculiar' some folks are about the rest seat/bunks. I did not respond. A short while later; the Captain answered a flight attendant call from the very back of the airplane. That flight attendant also complained to him about the change to their breaks.When it was time for my break; the bunk was empty; but both bunks still had dirty linens on the beds. I cleaned up the lower bunk and took my rest. The whole situation was very upsetting and made falling asleep difficult; but I did finally manage to get some rest.Crew relations were strained between the flight deck and the cabin as a result of this episode. CRM on the flight deck was significantly negatively impacted as well. Dealing with this issue was an unnecessary distraction to the safe operation of our flight. The rest of the flight was uneventful and there was no further discussion of rest seats/bunks.\nThe Flight Attendant crew rest facility was deferred and was not to be occupied. The Purser asked if the FAs could use the pilot crew rest bunk room during the flight. The Flight Deck Crew consisted of 3 male pilots and one female pilot. In an attempt to try to accommodate the request I asked the other pilots 1. If they were going to use the bunk and 2. If they would be willing to accommodate the flight attendants provided that no pilot would be in the bunk room. The three male pilots agreed to take a business class seat if they were available. The Female pilot insisted that no one be in the bunk with her. So this immediately made the request not possible; also no business class seats other than 1A was available. No Flight Attendant used the bunk room during the flight. And the female pilot was in the bunk room by herself as she stipulated during her break. To my knowledge 'NO' violation of bunk SOP took place.", {"entities": [[22, 29, "CREW"], [213, 220, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [261, 270, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [441, 448, "CREW"], [478, 489, "CREW"], [507, 518, "CREW"], [531, 538, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [670, 681, "CREW"], [832, 843, "CREW"], [868, 873, "AIRPLANE"], [929, 940, "CREW"], [946, 953, "CREW"], [966, 972, "CREW"], [1097, 1104, "CREW"], [1238, 1255, "CREW"], [1391, 1396, "AIRPLANE"], [1439, 1446, "CREW"], [1555, 1561, "CREW"], [1640, 1645, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1736, 1743, "CREW"], [1902, 1909, "CREW"], [1964, 1981, "CREW"], [2027, 2034, "CREW"], [2095, 2099, "AIRPLANE"], [2107, 2112, "AIRPLANE"], [2153, 2161, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2167, 2174, "CREW"], [2221, 2225, "AIRPLANE"], [2416, 2422, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2450, 2456, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2473, 2479, "CREW"], [2527, 2534, "CREW"], [2612, 2616, "AIRPLANE"], [2630, 2637, "CREW"], [2658, 2675, "CREW"], [2794, 2811, "CREW"], [2823, 2828, "CREW"], [2930, 2939, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2977, 2981, "AIRPLANE"], [3035, 3039, "AIRPLANE"], [3104, 3120, "CREW"], [3187, 3204, "CREW"], [3251, 3258, "CREW"], [3304, 3321, "CREW"], [3511, 3518, "CREW"], [3613, 3620, "CREW"], [3700, 3707, "CREW"], [3788, 3793, "CREW"], [3893, 3910, "CREW"], [3929, 3936, "CREW"], [4042, 4046, "AIRPLANE"], [4077, 4084, "CREW"], [4154, 4161, "CREW"], [4230, 4234, "AIRPLANE"], [4286, 4293, "CREW"], [4305, 4321, "CREW"], [4368, 4384, "CREW"], [4766, 4771, "AIRPLANE"], [5181, 5186, "CREW"], [5267, 5273, "CREW"], [5289, 5294, "CREW"], [5362, 5368, "CREW"], [5458, 5475, "CREW"], [5493, 5498, "CREW"], [5541, 5547, "CREW"], [5580, 5584, "AIRPLANE"], [5620, 5625, "CREW"], [5854, 5859, "CREW"]]}],
	["As I returned from [my] last break the [Relief Pilot] in the right seat started his brief on aircraft status. As I settled back into my duty station; the [Relief Pilot] then asked ATC if we were supposed to cross [fix] at 31000 ft. ATC confirmed that we were cleared to cross [fix] at 31000 ft. We were currently at 37000 ft. approximately 4 miles northwest of the fix. The Mode Control Panel altitude selector had never been set to the crossing altitude of 31000 ft. The legs page was correctly set for the crossing at 31000 ft. The Other [Relief Pilot] who was present during the ATC crossing clearance was out of the cockpit taking a final bathroom break as is typical during the crew's final return before top of descent.ATC subsequently cleared us to descend to 31000 ft.; and made no mention of any traffic conflict. We continued on to [our] destination with no further issues. This was an oversight of not properly following SOP during a very busy phase of flight; and forgetting to reset the altitude selector around the same time they were undoubtedly calling back to the cabin to wake the First Officer and myself at the end of our rest period. When I returned to the cockpit neither [Relief Pilot] briefed the descent clearance; I was unaware until the [Relief Pilot] in the right seat asked ATC about the clearance. One major factor in this oversight was undoubtedly due to a passenger in the cabin being in the forward lavatory for an extensive period of time.Our return to the cockpit was delayed much longer than normal; as the passenger was in the lavatory for at least fifteen minutes; and blocked our return to the cockpit after our final rest period. I was resting in a seat and the First Officer was in the lower bunk.

Approximately 100 [miles] east of waypoint at XB:15 some of the Flight Attendants started to complain of an acrid odor in the aft galley. We ran the Volcanic Ash Non-Normal procedure. It appeared that we did not fly into actual volcanic ash after referencing the checklist. It is possible we did enter a sulfur dioxide gas cloud; or less likely; in my opinion; into an ozone layer.

Hence; even a beautiful rotation at the prescribed Vr would not avoid a late unstick speed if the proper pitch angle wasn't used; not to mention adversely affecting our single engine climb segments.", {"entities": [[80, 87, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [435, 439, "AIRPLANE"], [522, 527, "AIRPLANE"], [642, 648, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [661, 664, "ABBREVIATION"], [685, 687, "ABBREVIATION"], [809, 814, "ALTITUDE"], [939, 946, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1142, 1148, "AIRPLANE"], [1149, 1154, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["Operating Flight XXXX we executed the XXXXX arrival planning for Runway XXC that was being advertised on the arrival D-ATIS. The winds were appropriately 210/200 @19 G31. We discussed the possibility of landing on Runway XXC with auto-brakes 4 and max thrust reversers. The Captain stated that he didn't think that was a good idea because of the strong crosswind and rather to just rely on the brakes vs TR due to the crosswind component and cited the ZZZ runway incident. I agreed and we planned on using idle TR and Auto-brakes 4. However the Captain computed the performance with wet runway and flaps 30; although on the D-ATIS there was no FICON (Field Condition report) or mention of wet-runway conditions; but justified his using those performance that with the NOTAMS for wet runway that were 6 hours old. I mentioned to him that due to the gusty winds I thought it would be a good idea to use flaps 25 due to the possibility of FLAP RELIEF and was told 'it wouldn't be a problem.' Once we got closer to the terminal area; the new ATIS stated Runway XYR was now in use and I asked for performance and again stated I would like flaps 25 because of the wind gust component and our weight so close to flaps 30 speed. The Captain again programmed the performance with wet runway although there was no FICON or mention of wet runway on the ATIS; and used flaps 30. I explained to him that 'if we hit flap relief below 1;000; we would be unstable and would have to go around and I thought that would be an issue due to the gusty winds.' I was again ignored and the Captain computed the performance for flaps 30 with MAX AUTO brakes.At appropriately 800 ft. on the first ILS to XYR we got the Flaps Relief EICAS message and I called 'unstable go-around.' We executed a go around that was uneventful and was given a heading and told to climb to 5;000 ft. The go around went fine and I again expressed concern for the flaps 30 speeds vs 25; as well as the wet runway performance that I thought was unnecessary; and I was told 'FLAPS 30; even if we get the flaps relief below 1;000 we will continue' I told the Captain 'I was not comfortable with that and if necessary we could use Runway XXC if we had to go around again.' This time the Captain elected to use the BRAKING ACTION GOOD on performance; although there was no FICON; and told me that flaps 25 was not an option and to stop 'over-controlling the throttles' even though our REF speed plus gust additive was 165 kts. and flaps 30 speed was 180. On the 2nd ILS to XYR we again got the Flaps Relief at appropriately 600 ft. and I again called 'unstable go around' and hit the TOGA switch. The Captain said 'I have the controls; and that I (me) was absolutely right for going around but we were going to land anyways' I replied with 'your controls' and noted the fuel was appropriately 13.4T. The Captain started to explain his reasoning for landing and I told him ''we could talk about on the ground.' He then dove for the runway unstable and landed on Runway XYR after the autopilot had already started initiating a go around and increasing TOGA thrust. After landing the taxi in was uneventful; and after shutdown he replied that 'he hoped I wasn't upset' in which I replied that I was; and that I was going to file a report. The Captain then said he was going to have to file a lot of paperwork and said he was sorry for taking the controls.I think the culture of Captains not valuing their First Officers' experience and ideas has become toxic at [company name]; and there needs to be a change. This particular Captain had taken the time to explain a lot of valuable information before and during the flight; clarifying the FCOM; the new 'Briefing the Glass' procedure; De-ice procedure etc. Which I was very appreciative of; however I think he took on the role that he was the teacher and that I had nothing to offer him as a pilot no matter my experience level or knowledge base.\nFO (First Officer) was PF (Pilot Flying). During the arrival briefing; his briefing did not include 'Fuel Plan' and a few other required items. As I was going over the briefing items he had missed; we discussed the fuel burn to our alternate would be about 5 tons so we wouldn't have a lot of extra fuel or time if something happened at our destination before we would have to divert. The FMC reserve was 11.1. Due to strong and gusty winds the approach speed included a 20 kt. additive and was 171. Initially ZZZ was landing to the west and he was confused about proper wind additives and also mentioned that we would have to land at flaps 25 because of Flap Relief. At the beginning of the flight he informed me that he did a lot of flying outside of [company name] so if I saw or heard something the wasn't correct; to let him know. We reviewed the wind additives for the headwind component and agreed that only a small additive would be needed for the planned landing Runway XXC since the wind was 70 degrees off runway heading. He also briefed that he would use Max reverse thrust. We discussed the disadvantages of using max reverse in a strong crosswind situation and I asked that he change his plan to instead use the FCOM standard of idle reverse. Late in the descent; the airport changed to landing on XYR.The NOTAMs for the airport listed XXL/XYR as wet with FICON 5/5/5. The FDP required Max Manual braking for that condition. We queried Tower and received info that the only report they currently had was braking action good. With that information we could use Max Auto braking at flaps 30. I told him then that we could go back to his initial plan of using max reverse since we no longer had a strong crosswind. We received vectors and flew the ILS XYR. On the first approach we accomplished a go-around due to the FO (PF) using poor thrust technique by adding and subtracting too much thrust for the momentary atmospheric airspeed deviations. The airspeed would jump 5 knots or so above the bug and the FO would slam the thrust to idle. Then as the airspeed started to fall below the bug he would rapidly bring in too much thrust causing the airspeed to increase to 180 and cause the Flap Relief advisory on the EICAS. I told him that with smaller thrust corrections on the second approach we shouldn't get the Flap Relief issue again. I thought he was using thrust technique that worked for the other aircraft he said he was flying. On the second approach with the same conditions; I coached him to use smaller thrust corrections which he initially did with good results. Just after the 1;000 ft. stable call; he again made too large of a thrust correction and caused the Flap Relief message and he; the FO; (FP) called go-around. I glanced at the fuel remaining and thought it said 11. In my opinion at that time; I thought it was safer to continue the approach because of the fuel state; the transient atmospheric airspeed deviations; the proper alignment with the runway and being in VMC on proper glidepath. I announced that; ' I have the aircraft' and made an uneventful landing. On the ground I told the FO that he was 100% correct in his callouts and actions. I said that in my opinion; at that time; I thought it was safer to continue than to execute another go-around and possibly get into a critical fuel state. After we blocked in and accomplished all checklists; I tried to explain my decision and to reinforce that what he did was correct from his perspective. The FO was upset and disagreed with my assessment. I would have much preferred to accomplish another go-around. I did not take lightly the decision to exercise my emergency authority and do what I thought was the safer course of action. I know this is a 'no-win' situation. If I had it to do over again; I would have flown the second approach myself instead of letting him fly it again.", {"entities": [[1158, 1162, "WEATHER"], [1163, 1167, "WEATHER"], [1439, 1447, "WEATHER"], [1734, 1742, "WEATHER"], [2447, 2451, "WEATHER"], [2599, 2607, "WEATHER"], [2985, 2993, "WEATHER"], [4512, 4516, "WEATHER"], [4793, 4797, "WEATHER"], [4934, 4938, "WEATHER"], [119, 123, "ABBREVIATION"], [274, 281, "CREW"], [353, 362, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [418, 427, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [456, 462, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [545, 552, "CREW"], [587, 593, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [626, 630, "ABBREVIATION"], [693, 699, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [783, 789, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1015, 1023, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1038, 1042, "ABBREVIATION"], [1225, 1232, "CREW"], [1275, 1281, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1328, 1334, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1342, 1346, "ABBREVIATION"], [1402, 1406, "AIRPLANE"], [1466, 1475, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1566, 1573, "CREW"], [1650, 1656, "ALTITUDE"], [1671, 1674, "ABBREVIATION"], [1706, 1711, "AIRPLANE"], [1835, 1840, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1844, 1852, "ALTITUDE"], [1958, 1964, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2108, 2115, "CREW"], [2203, 2212, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2235, 2242, "CREW"], [2469, 2472, "ABBREVIATION"], [2513, 2516, "ABBREVIATION"], [2571, 2577, "ALTITUDE"], [2608, 2617, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2631, 2635, "ABBREVIATION"], [2648, 2655, "CREW"], [2724, 2736, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2758, 2762, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2851, 2858, "CREW"], [2978, 2984, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2998, 3004, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3029, 3038, "AIRPLANE"], [3097, 3101, "ABBREVIATION"], [3116, 3123, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3287, 3294, "CREW"], [3570, 3577, "CREW"], [3886, 3891, "CREW"], [3935, 3939, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3941, 3943, "ABBREVIATION"], [3945, 3958, "CREW"], [4386, 4394, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4459, 4466, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4568, 4572, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4676, 4682, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4958, 4964, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5092, 5101, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5210, 5217, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5242, 5249, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5391, 5396, "CREW"], [5656, 5665, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5691, 5695, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5700, 5703, "ABBREVIATION"], [5722, 5730, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5749, 5758, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5770, 5772, "ABBREVIATION"], [5959, 5961, "ABBREVIATION"], [6168, 6173, "AIRPLANE"], [6237, 6245, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6382, 6388, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6404, 6412, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6544, 6552, "ALTITUDE"], [6661, 6663, "ABBREVIATION"], [6677, 6686, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6811, 6819, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6924, 6930, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [7067, 7069, "ABBREVIATION"], [7435, 7437, "ABBREVIATION"], [7748, 7753, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7765, 7773, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7804, 7807, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["I was the PF (Pilot Flying); the First Officer was the PM (Pilot Monitoring). During climbout we noticed fumes that would not dissipate. We contacted the flight attendants and asked them if they smelled anything. They said there was an exhaust smell throughout the entire cabin and that they and a passenger were experiencing adverse symptoms. We transferred control and I ran the Smoke; Fire or Fumes in Passenger Cabin or Flight Deck checklist. Through the checklist we decided to divert back to our origination airport. I found the Air Quality Event checklist and referenced that. We advised ATC and requested ARFF to meet the aircraft. We had an uneventful overweight landing. We had a large margin in our landing data. All passengers were offered medical assistance. To my knowledge all declined. Our three flight attendants asked to be medically evaluated due to varying degrees of dizziness; burning eyes; burning throats; light headedness; etc. Two flight attendants were given oxygen. All flight attendants declined transport to the hospital. We debriefed over the event. The Smoke; Fire or Fumes in Passenger Cabin or Flight Deck checklist was ran. In the moment there was confusion about a part of the checklist regarding turning on all lights in the cabin. It was daylight and since we did not know the origin of the smell we elected not to have all lights turned on. The reasoning was not clear at the time why the checklist was directing that action. We were within minutes of landing so we elected to take the safest course of action to continue with the checklist. We believed the smell to be dissipating after completing the checklist items. During the debrief the flight attendants thought the smell was intensifying with the aircraft below 10;000. Inflight; the flight attendants had said the smell was consistent.The cause was unknown; even after a ground-run of the aircraft. Recommendations would be for a small note to be added for the reasoning of turning on the cabin lights. I can only speculate about the reasoning at this point. Another strong recommendation would be for checklists like the 'Air Quality Event' and security 'Threat Levels' to be in more accessible 'books' than the FOM. They share a lot of similarities. They are run and used like checklists; they are both difficult to find and both have time critical information in them. Events like smoke and fumes have a lot of moving parts to juggle and it would be safer if information found in the checklists were more intuitive to find instead of being part of the treasure hunt that are our manuals.", {"entities": [[2382, 2387, "WEATHER"], [33, 46, "CREW"], [154, 171, "CREW"], [272, 277, "AIRPLANE"], [595, 598, "CREW"], [812, 829, "CREW"], [957, 974, "CREW"], [998, 1015, "CREW"], [1262, 1267, "AIRPLANE"], [1682, 1699, "CREW"], [1781, 1798, "CREW"], [1987, 1992, "AIRPLANE"]]}],

	["Second leg of day. Flying from ZZZ to ZZZ1. Pilot Flying was FO (First Officer); I was the Pilot Monitoring although the Captain. Weather was VMC. ZZZ1 was landing RWY XXL utilizing RNAV XX Z. We flew the approach utilizing RNAV procedures; Vertical Speed; with altitude settings set for each altitude restriction. All altitude restrictions and procedures were briefed according to standard briefing card.  Prior reaching the final approach fix at 2;400 ft.; we set the LNAV MDA for the approach which was 1;020. Upon reaching the FAF; we began our descent to the MDA looking toward ZZZZZ as the MAP. Upon arriving at MDA; the runway was clear in visual sight approximately 4 NM; the flying pilot concentrated on maintaining the final approach course which is offset by 11 degrees. Ride was light to moderate turbulence. We never went below MDA. At this point; we were given a low altitude alert by Tower; we acknowledged this radio call and climbed higher above MDA.

Although we briefed that restriction at cruise altitude; during the business of the ZZZ airspace arrival; traffic; and busy; gusty approach; we both mistakenly utilized the loaded FMS waypoints.

	["This incident occurred on the second of two training flights today. I was instructing a new hire pilot.

We were given an intercept heading and told to maintain 1700 feet until established cleared for the ILS approach. The student became disoriented with autopilot procedures and I allowed myself to get too involved with helping him sort that out and lost my situational awareness. I allowed the aircraft to inadvertently descended 500 feet below the assigned published altitude. At 1200 feet I saw altimeter; immediately disengaged the autopilot and aggressively began a steep climb to 1700 feet at full power.

After giving the aircraft back to the student after a low approach; he again became overwhelmed and busted another climb altitude assignment by 250 feet. At that point I terminated the training flight; took over the duties as sole manipulator of the controls and flew the aircraft back to home base uneventfully; allowing the student to only work the GPS and set up the approach into our home airport. I had a long week of ground school instruction followed by office duties which had me working an average 12 hours a day 6 days in a row. The first flight in an actual aircraft with the student in the morning should have been our only flight today. I tried to conduct a second flight due to operational tempo.

I then asked for and got direct ZZZ from ZZZ Center.The following represents a timeline of the subsequent events and my actions:* Put ZZZ in active waypoint for FMC and engaged LNAV to head there* Asked Dispatch to put me in contact with MedLink* Had interphone; ATC; and Dispatch receivers all up on my headset and speaker; switching between transmitters when I needed to talk* Turned up Dispatch comm on my speaker so the Flight Attendant in the right seat could hear and relay MedLink questions as needed to the doctor(s) in back (she did a great job in that role)* Determined time to touchdown; 45 mins* Made PA; told [passengers] we were diverting to ZZZ for a medical emergency* Made Purser aware of time to touchdown* Began putting in reminder circles around ZZZ on the fix page [125nm; 100nm)* Got pilot discretion descent to FL280; recruised the FMC immediately and started descent so I wouldn't forget* Changed destination in FMC to ZZZ* Got ZZZ ATIS* Dispatch pushed ZZZ landing data for [Runway] XXC to printer along with new flight plan and fuel burn data* Determined we would be 5300 lbs.overweight for landing and agreed with Dispatch that this was warranted* ATC passed to ZZZ Center* Told ATC I wanted vectors to final [Runway] XXC and progressive taxi to gate once on ground* ZZZ Center advised gate would be XX (they got this info from company)* Switched iPad EFB to ZZZ and reviewed [Runway] XXC ILS and taxi chart for perhaps 2 mins* Set up approach for [Runway] XXC and cleaned up FMC by extending 2nd to last fix on the approach (automatically loads correct final extension course)* Received pilot discretion descent clearance to 14;000 ft. but too far out to start down; so put in a 75 mile ring as a reminder on the fix page and also asked ATC to remind me if it appeared I had forgotten to start down* Told ATC I would monitor freq but would be working another radio* Personally talked to the doctoron the aircraft and wrapped up the call with Dispatch and Medlink; insuring we were doing what we could on the aircraft for my First Officer; and checked that an ambulance would meet us* Called Purser and finalized time to landing* Had the Flight Attendant in the right seat continue to monitor the medical situation with First Officer* Told her that I was going to brief her on the approach as if she were another pilot so that I would be in my normal habit pattern and wouldn't miss anything* Elected CAT I ILS to manual landing as this is what I'd normally do (tried throughout the event to stay with long established habit if possible)* Briefed ILS XXC to ZZZ* Set approach speeds and autobrakes* Ran descent checklist (reset landing cabin altitude)* ATC called at this point just as we were passing the 75 nm circle.* Started down to 14;000 ft.; recleared to 13;000 ft.* ATC advised icing present on approach to ZZZ* Briefed the flight attendant that I would like her to remind me to turn off the wing and engine anti ice switches after we broke out of the clouds on final (I pointed them out; and she was able to remind me)* Reset altimeter passing FL190* Flew 300 kts. in the descent until 10;000 ft. to get F/O on the ground* Double ding on chime and verbally confirmed cabin ready passing 16;000 ft. (early; to shift workload away from 10;000 ft. where I'd have to remember to slow down)* Handed to ZZZ Approach* Continued descent to 5;000 then 4;000* Good; reasonable; conservative speeds were assigned by ATC throughout descent and approach below 10;000* Configured flaps myself as we decelerated through max flap SOP speeds* Flaps 20 and gear down (myself) at G/S intercept* Early Landing checklist (myself) at this point to shift workload from later busier time (final deceleration and final flap configuration nearer FAF)* Set TD zone elevation* 2;500 ft. call out made by me and answered by me* Slow to target and final flaps outside FAF* Over to tower* 1;000 ft. call made and answered by me* Set the missed approach altitude* Broke out at 800 ft.* Auto pilot off* Missed making the 500 ft. call* At 100 ft. auto throttles off* Touchdown and rollout uneventful* Made XX taxiway off of XXC* I quickly found it was VERY difficult to clean-up; taxi; talk; and navigate simultaneously on the ground at ZZZ* Ground wanted a right turn; but I made a left on X taxiway; they then cleared me via a revised route; and helped me the rest of the way in; calling turns* Would suggest that if I could do it over; I'd have stopped; set the brake; cleaned up the aircraft; reviewed the taxi route with ground control; then set out again* As it was; ZZZ Ground was very good; flexed to my degraded capability; and called my turns from there on in* Asked the flight attendant to watch outside as while I was switching freqs for obstacles and other aircraft as I was momentarily distracted by the tuning of radios* Parked at XX met by ambulance* Shut down right engine and started APU* Once APU running; shut down left engine* Ran parking checklistThe above timeline represents only my perception of the events and my performance. I suspect that there were many things I missed; but I'll probably never know what they were. I believe this uneventful outcome was in great part due to outstanding help from my crew; from ATC; and from Dispatch; and perhaps to my reliance on habit and doing things just as if there were still a pilot monitoring on the flight deck. I went to the extent of verbalizing both sides of the SOP call outs; and verbally briefing approach as just two examples.My Flight Attendant 'copilot' was a great asset and performed remarkably well in her delegated task of communicating with the cabin. More than that though; the presence of another person; properly trained or not; was still very useful from a CRM perspective. There are small bits of workload and reminders that can be shared with any reasonable crew member; and she did a great job for me.The main lesson learned for me was after landing. As stated above; I would advocate that a pilot in this situation stop after exiting the runway and set the brake. One could then easily clean up the aircraft; review the taxi route (or arrange for a tow; if the crew positions were reversed) and then set off for the gate after a mental reset. I had my First Officer on my mind though; and I had some continuation bias working. I wanted to get him to the gate; and this is where leaning heavily on the familiar procedure (keep rolling and clean up on the fly) probably wasn't the best choice. It never occurred to me ahead of time that stopping for a minute would have been safer for all of us. It worked out just fine; but in retrospect; this is where I felt the most vulnerable: on the taxi-in at ZZZ. The controllers sensed this; after that initial wrong turn; and they babysat me for the rest of the way in; which was appreciated.", {"entities": [[1992, 2002, "WEATHER"], [4825, 4830, "WEATHER"], [0, 13, "CREW"], [35, 41, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [51, 54, "CREW"], [66, 74, "CREW"], [105, 108, "CREW"], [110, 118, "CREW"], [258, 275, "CREW"], [303, 311, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [326, 330, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [337, 343, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [370, 375, "ALTITUDE"], [380, 393, "CREW"], [771, 777, "CREW"], [809, 826, "CREW"], [850, 863, "CREW"], [929, 934, "CREW"], [1123, 1127, "AIRPLANE"], [1185, 1191, "CREW"], [1253, 1266, "CREW"], [1281, 1287, "CREW"], [1628, 1633, "AIRPLANE"], [1688, 1691, "CREW"], [1696, 1704, "CREW"], [1837, 1842, "AIRPLANE"], [1860, 1868, "CREW"], [2215, 2223, "CREW"], [2275, 2278, "CREW"], [2284, 2292, "CREW"], [2401, 2409, "CREW"], [2466, 2470, "AIRPLANE"], [2600, 2609, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2625, 2627, "ABBREVIATION"], [2726, 2735, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2818, 2823, "CREW"], [2835, 2842, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2846, 2851, "ALTITUDE"], [2895, 2902, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2968, 2972, "ABBREVIATION"], [2974, 2982, "CREW"], [3153, 3161, "CREW"], [3187, 3190, "CREW"], [3218, 3221, "CREW"], [3285, 3289, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3325, 3329, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3428, 3431, "ABBREVIATION"], [3474, 3482, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3555, 3563, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3627, 3632, "CREW"], [3644, 3651, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3665, 3674, "ALTITUDE"], [3777, 3780, "CREW"], [3845, 3848, "CREW"], [3899, 3904, "AIRPLANE"], [3982, 3990, "CREW"], [4064, 4077, "CREW"], [4207, 4211, "AIRPLANE"], [4259, 4272, "CREW"], [4320, 4328, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4352, 4357, "CREW"], [4396, 4403, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4446, 4449, "ABBREVIATION"], [4586, 4589, "ABBREVIATION"], [4606, 4614, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4642, 4649, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4675, 4680, "AIRPLANE"], [4692, 4695, "CREW"], [4776, 4785, "ALTITUDE"], [4801, 4810, "ALTITUDE"], [4813, 4816, "CREW"], [4842, 4850, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4871, 4887, "CREW"], [4939, 4943, "AIRPLANE"], [4948, 4954, "AIRPLANE"], [5074, 5083, "AIRPLANE"], [5092, 5097, "ALTITUDE"], [5099, 5103, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5108, 5111, "ABBREVIATION"], [5120, 5127, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5134, 5143, "ALTITUDE"], [5152, 5155, "ABBREVIATION"], [5215, 5220, "AIRPLANE"], [5235, 5244, "ALTITUDE"], [5282, 5291, "ALTITUDE"], [5349, 5357, "CREW"], [5369, 5376, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5453, 5456, "CREW"], [5468, 5475, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5480, 5488, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5557, 5561, "AIRPLANE"], [5742, 5746, "AIRPLANE"], [5797, 5805, "ALTITUDE"], [5899, 5904, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5906, 5914, "ALTITUDE"], [5954, 5969, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5993, 5999, "ALTITUDE"], [6007, 6012, "CREW"], [6036, 6042, "ALTITUDE"], [6053, 6059, "ALTITUDE"], [6081, 6090, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6123, 6130, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6256, 6262, "CREW"], [6307, 6314, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6591, 6597, "CREW"], [6695, 6711, "CREW"], [6850, 6856, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6897, 6903, "AIRPLANE"], [6916, 6919, "AIRPLANE"], [6926, 6929, "AIRPLANE"], [6954, 6960, "AIRPLANE"], [7254, 7257, "CREW"], [7268, 7276, "CREW"], [7361, 7366, "CREW"], [7489, 7497, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7645, 7650, "AIRPLANE"], [7999, 8004, "CREW"], [8046, 8052, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [8224, 8228, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [8260, 8273, "CREW"], [8362, 8366, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],
	["Second leg day two of a four day [trip]. First leg was a challenge due to weather issues. Second leg was a domestic flight. We transitioned from international terminal to domestic through walk and bus system. The First Officer tried to use Mobile Passport app for reentry into US and had some problems. We met at the aircraft. I was busy getting the aircraft ready and the First Officer proceeded to walk around. We were anti iced at the gate. We were never told to prepare the aircraft for de ice and was not configured for the procedure when told it was completed. There was some confusion on our part about dispatching into known severe turbulence and I called the Dispatcher to discuss. It was explained to me that WSI was controlling weather source and not ATIS. WSI had no severe turbulence information so we proceeded. After takeoff ATC informed us that a another air carrier reported severe turbulence at FL210. We leveled off a FL190. The flight attendants were briefed to stay in seats until contacted otherwise. I called the Purser to inform him they were to stay in seats for duration of flight. Passengers were informed to stay in seats and the seatbelt sign was kept on for duration of the flight. We were unable to land at our destination so we diverted and desired to write the aircraft up in logbook for a severe turbulence encounter. There was much miscommunication regarding unable to continue; fatigue; and Maintenance; [that was] needed prior to aircraft being released. This was all my fault.

	["Shortly after being handed off to NYC Approach near the SWEET Intersection going into EWR; ATC cleared us from 7;000 feet to 6;000 feet on a heading of 110. Once the descent began; ATC issued a traffic alert for an aircraft climbing through 5;000 feet on a southwest heading towards us that he was not talking to. I acknowledged the traffic; picked them up visually and stated we may get an alert on this traffic.My FO (First Officer) put his hands on the controls in preparation for flying manually. I then noticed the TCAS target climbing through about 5;300 feet; and within seconds we received a Climb RA. The FO manually took control of the airplane and complied with the RA.After a few blocked transmissions; we were able to advise ATC. Approach then issued a turn to 190 as we leveled around 6;300-6;400 feet. Once cleared of the conflict; we returned to 6;000 feet. The remainder of the approach was uneventful and the were no issues with our cabin crew who were performing their final cabin checks. Our altitudes were about 500-600 feet apart and the lateral distance appeared to be a similar distance.Regarding the conflicting traffic; it was a low wing; single engine general aviation aircraft; possibly a Cirrus aircraft.

	["There was a large fuel spill. Between the XX and YY gates; originating from an underground fuel hydrant. The fuel erupted from the hydrant and proceeded to flood the immediate gate area as well as covering approximately two gates down (flowing westward). The local airport fire authority was contacted and responded as well as the Airport Operations.On going to work for my shift I immediately smelt the Jet-A fumes as soon as the shuttle transport van dropped me off at the ZZ gate. Within seconds of entering the terminal I began to get a headache as well as taste a metallic taste in my mouth from the fumes. I was very disconcerted by this as I knew that I still had an entire shift ahead of me in this very unsafe condition. On speaking to my associates I learned that they sat though these events in an office that was saturated in the heavy smell of Jet-A. They were give masks as an option to wear that are not OSHA approved for working in gas fumed environments (the masks were more or less cheap painters masks). There were complaints from fellow employees of headaches; nausea; dizziness; foul tastes in their mouths and dis-ease in general.To my knowledge the only evacuation given was by order of the on-site fire chief for ramp side personnel but not to those in the building. There was no back-up location to go to to escape this unsafe and hazardous condition; if there is one available then it was not utilized. On leaving the airport at the end of my shift I had to remove my work clothes as they reeked of fuel and had to take a shower as my exposed skin and hair smelled of fuel as well. As I write this I still have a stinging in my nose and feel stuffy in my head and sinuses. I worry for my health considering that I was breathing carcinogenic fumes for 9 hours.I do not feel that [Company] adhered in any way; shape or form to its own values that it touts at every chance that it gets to. I accept that incidents happen but it is how we deal with them and treat our employees when they occur that shows our worth. I feel less safe; and significantly less confident in the local management's abilities to look after my safety and well being while I am at work.\nA substantial fuel spill occurred in the ramp area of Gate. This led to a large clean up effort; that led to multiple gate areas and the smoking area to be closed for much of the shift. Due to the proximity to the spill area; the Service Oversight Center was also affected. Strong odors of aviation fuel filled the SOC; but the lack of action by management little was done to rectify the situation. Throughout the course of the afternoon shift; strong smells of aviation fuel were pervasive throughout the SOC; and some of the passenger terminal adjacent to the gate areas affected by the spill. One Ground employee was transported as a result of the fumes. Other than opening doors and using fans to try and air out the SOC; very little was done to ensure the wellbeing of employees working. Management told employees that if they felt unwell; they could take a temporary walk or break outside of the SOC; which is not a permanent solution to the situation. Little regard was given for the well being of SOC employees in this circumstance. Other than plastic masks; no protection was given to the employees; and no alternate work areas could be arranged to keep employees out of an area that had a strong odor of aviation fuel. This was not a healthy or safe work environment; and lots more could be done in order to ensure the health and wellbeing of those scheduled to work during this shift. The odors became so bad at one point; that inflight elected to move their scheduled SOC personnel back to the inflight base instead. Instead of providing alternate work areas for SOC employees to safely perform their duties; it was decided that it would be best to just work with fans blowing and all doors to the ramp area open in an attempt to air out the SOC. This simply resulted in the odor of fuel to be constantly present in the SOC throughout the course of the shift.", {"entities": [[1548, 1554, "WEATHER"], [176, 180, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [478, 482, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [515, 523, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1237, 1241, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1654, 1658, "AIRPLANE"], [2225, 2229, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2302, 2306, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2721, 2729, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2746, 2750, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2784, 2790, "CREW"], [3699, 3703, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3894, 3898, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],
	["This event occurred at XA45Z. We were parking. After landing on Runway 04 we exited on U then were cleared to taxi R hold short 13. Reaching 13 we were cleared to cross; then Taxi R; P; B. I did not hear the Controller say P; but the FO apparently did. As we cleared 13; the FO contacted Ops and Ramp per procedure. I continued to taxi straight ahead down R to B and did not make the left turn on to P. I switched to Ground to hear the Controller calling us. Controller said something I did not catch then told us to taxi to the ramp on B. After we parked the FO informed me of the taxi error.Confusing; non-intuitive taxi route - R; P; B; requires a left turn immediately after a runway crossing; then a greater than 270 degree right turn onto B. It is an unexpected way to taxi to B (unless perhaps you are familiar with LGA). We had briefed possible taxi routes during the approach brief; but did not expect this one. High workload environment - company procedures require the PM to call ops and ramp during a busy time. The area is marked as a hot spot; but ATC requires the information about the gate.  Lack of experience - I have not been into LGA for about 18 months and it is my first time in as CA. I have only been into LGA about 5 times with PSA.  The FO has only been into [LGA] about 3 times.Suggestions: If this is a common taxi route it would help if it was noted in the company pages.\nMissed turn (Taxiway P) after crossing active Runway [13) south on Taxiway R while switching radios from Tower to Ground; continuing to Taxiway B. Taxiway R becomes Taxiway B in a straight line to our gate. Taxiway P to Taxiway B forms a circuitous route with a very sharp turn onto Taxiway B; apparently to avoid blocking high-speed Taxiway Q overrun. No proximate traffic or hazards were observed during event. Another aircraft was lined up and awaiting departure on Runway 13 during event.Cause: Low experience FO paired with low experience Captain at airport for first time in approximately 18 months. Non-intuitive taxi route instructions in high workload environment -- switching and splitting radio duties to comply with company and ATC procedures; which asked for two additional radio calls on Number 2 radio during taxi operations -- coupled with compressed hearback/readback caused poor interpretation of instructions; which culminated in continuing forward all the way to the gate in the most direct path.Suggestions: Taxiing around (R-P-B) the high-speed Taxiway Q after landing Runway 4 makes sense; but is not intuitive when exiting Runway 4 at Taxiway U (or even Taxiway P). A company page or reference with diagram to depict this awkward taxi path (sharp turns well in excess of 90 degrees when direct path to gate requires no turns) would be very useful for low experience pilots or infrequent visits.", {"entities": [[53, 60, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [110, 114, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [208, 218, "CREW"], [234, 236, "ABBREVIATION"], [275, 277, "ABBREVIATION"], [331, 335, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [417, 423, "CREW"], [436, 446, "CREW"], [459, 469, "CREW"], [517, 521, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [529, 533, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [549, 555, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [560, 562, "ABBREVIATION"], [681, 687, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [876, 884, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [999, 1003, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1048, 1056, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1062, 1065, "CREW"], [1101, 1105, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1204, 1206, "ABBREVIATION"], [1263, 1265, "ABBREVIATION"], [1506, 1511, "CREW"], [1515, 1521, "CREW"], [1602, 1606, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1915, 1917, "ABBREVIATION"], [1945, 1952, "CREW"], [2101, 2106, "AIRPLANE"], [2141, 2144, "CREW"], [2188, 2193, "AIRPLANE"], [2212, 2217, "AIRPLANE"], [2388, 2392, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2430, 2437, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2484, 2491, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2727, 2731, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2791, 2797, "CREW"]]}],
	["On climbout; shortly after passing 10;000 feet the cockpit began to fill with smoke. I received a call from the FA (Flight Attendant) a few seconds later reporting the cabin was also filling with smoke. We executed memory items for Cabin/Cockpit smoke. We were unable to determine the source of the smoke; so we ran the EPC for Smoke Removal. I then chose to return to departure airport and informed the FA and the Dispatcher. Once the smoke was removed from the aircraft it did not appear to return; so no further emergency checklists were run except for the overweight landing checklist. We conducted an overweight landing. After exiting the runway we were inspected by CFR. They noted no signs of fire or excessive heat signatures. The cockpit/cabin still showed no new or returning signs of smoke so we continued taxi to the gate. At the gate; CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) checked in with us again as to the condition of our Crew/Passengers. The FA reported no signs of injury or illness from the cabin. The FO (First Officer) and I were OK as well. Passengers were then deplaned and the aircraft was handed over to Maintenance.After speaking with Maintenance the following day; the cause of the smoke was determined to be a failed bearing in the ACM (Air Cycle Machine) of the Left Pack. The presence of smoke in both the cabin and the cockpit probably should have clued us in to the smoke being from the air conditioning system; but in the moment we weren't positive where is was coming from. The FO thought it had an electrical scent; and at times it appeared to be coming from behind the instrument panel. Because of this we never ran the Air Conditioning Smoke EPC. Once donning the O2 masks; CRM became VERY difficult. We correctly established crew communication per the appropriate methods; but even so those masks present a barrier to effective communication. Luckily we were close to ZZZ and I felt the most prudent course of action was to get the aircraft on the ground expeditiously. In our haste we neglected to officially run a Descent Checklist. I also never declared an emergency with ATC; but they gave us every assistance I asked for and I believe they may have declared for us. The Smoke Removal EPC also gives the option to deploy Passenger Oxygen which I elected not to do. I interpreted that to be for the potential high cabin alt that checklist could result in. By time we reached that line in the checklist the smoke was effectively removed and the cabin altitude was safe. I question that decision only because the FO and I wore our masks all the way to the ground yet I did not provide O2 to the passengers. While I'm satisfied with the end results of how we handled the situation; I know we missed a few steps along the way. Suggestions: More training with O2 Masks in the simulator would be helpful. Especially if they were targeted at smoke situations. In a rapid cabin depress scenario the masks are used to get you down to a safe altitude where they can be removed and the crew can regroup and reassess the situation.

Then we swapped headsets; the Digital Audio Panel; and the mic jacks with no luck. Maintenance Control decided that we needed to try swapping COMM 1 and 2. That swap did not work as well; so Maintenance Control decided that we needed to replace NIM II. The network interface module was looked up in the maintenance manual doing a aircraft specific search and verifying it in Maintenance Software under component replacement. The search came up which we did not have at our station but it had an alternate which we did have at our station. So with time constraints upon us we chose the NIM and proceeded to change NIM II. The NIM was installed and target load was completed without an issue. Replacing the NIM II did not fix the FO's comm issue. I decided to leave the newly installed NIM on the plane and place the NIM that was taken off the plane in the SAVE program.

Upon further research; LOSA looked at other tire assemblies installed on aircrafts around the maintenance base and Airbus serviceable tire rack assemblies and found part numbers that were not being reflected in the IPCs for the nose and main tires.

In addition; all tires that we looked at had the small-bore type valve stems.Whether or not this is the right configuration for Company Airbus fleet; clarification is needed to determine effectivity. If the larger bore type valve stem is effective for the airbus A319/A320; one of the concerns is that these aircrafts may fly to a station that may not have the adapter to service the tires because stations are not aware of the two different wheel assembly configurations.I have attached two sets of IPCs; one for the main wheels and the other for the nose wheel tires.

	["After performing a CAT III approach it was discovered that the Center Line (CL) lights were NOTAM'd out of service prior to beginning the approach but turned out to be operational during the landing.

ATC mentioned that other aircraft were making it in; but were reporting the ceiling to be right at minimums. The RVR received from the Tower was well within limits. With the above information we elected to perform a CAT III approach.The Pilot Flying briefed the approach and all checklists were run. The approach was successful having obtained the required visible items between 100 ft. and 200 ft. After exiting the runway a Company aircraft; who was 50 miles away; queried the Tower about the center lights being NOTAM'd out. Tower did state that the NOTAM for the centerline lights had been removed about one minute prior to this other aircraft's call. It was at that point we realized an error had been made by beginning the approach with the CL being OTS (Out of Service); only to have NOTAM technically be cleared during our final approach.Factors I believe that contributed to our mistake.

	["During recovery of Flight XXXX at ZZZ Gate XX the marshaller showed up in the safety zone shortly after we arrived. There were no wing walkers in position; so I called ZZZ Operations requesting wing walkers. It took several minutes for the wing walkers to arrive. When they finally arrived they meandered at a noticeably slow pace (no sense of urgency whatsoever). Each wing walker picked up one lighted wand (instead of the required 2 lighted wands) each. They walked slowly to their respective positions; and held up one lighted wand each. The marshaller; not noticing or not caring that his wing walkers had only one lighted wand each; began to marshall us into the safety zone. I called ZZZ Operations a second time requesting that each wing walker get a second lighted wand. By this time we were blocking nearly a dozen vehicles and aircraft.Why does each wing walker need two lighted wands at night? First of all it is the FAA mandated SOP of [the company] that says so. One wand held in the air indicates that everything is OK; the wing is clear of obstacles; etc. What happens when a wing walker detects a safety hazard? He must cross his lighted wands to communicate an 'Emergency Stop.' If he has only one lighted wand; he cannot give this signal. Blatant violation of safety rules at ZZZ (and many of our stations; particularly the big city locations) happens on a regular daily basis. Finally; another ramp agent showed up with an arm full of lighted wands and provided both wing walkers with a second lighted wand. We had been waiting for 6 minutes with a plane load of passengers by this time. If our SOP requires compliance with a safety related procedure mandated by the FAA; it should be complied with 100% of the time. Why not just do the right thing to begin with rather than waiting for someone to remind the ramp agents to do their job correctly? It is because there is a poor 'climate;' starting with ZZZ leadership; to tolerate non-compliance. Leadership does not appear to properly train; supervise; observe; or care to correct those in non-compliance. Why do I say this? Because non-compliance is accepted and tolerated without consequence; and there is a lack of accountability in ZZZ all too often. Blatant; daily; noncompliance with the FAA mandated SOP on the ZZZ ramp has become the 'norm.' I spoke with 2 ZZZ [ramp managers]; and I was shocked by their comments and poor attitude. They were dismissive; evasive; denied that there was a chronic problem; and seemed uninterested in hearing the opinion of a pilot concerning recommendations to solve the problem. They were more interested in defending their inaction; making excuses; stonewalling; and giving ' lip service' to the issue than they were in taking effective steps to correct the ongoing problem.This is a leadership problem in ZZZ. If leadership does not lead from the top; communicate high standards of SOP compliance; conduct ongoing training; hold supervisors accountable; follow up with observing the operation on the ramp in person to ensure compliance; the ramp agents will sense that leadership does not care; so why should they? Merely putting out a memorandum to request compliance is not enough. Leaders need to get out of their offices; make daily unannounced appearances on the flight line; show interest in the individuals on the ramp; hold ramp agents accountable when they fail; and reward ramp agents when they do a good job! We need to do better to reduce the risk of dinging a wing or crunching a winglet.", {"entities": [[1899, 1906, "WEATHER"], [107, 114, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [130, 134, "AIRPLANE"], [194, 198, "AIRPLANE"], [240, 244, "AIRPLANE"], [256, 262, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [282, 289, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [370, 374, "AIRPLANE"], [594, 598, "AIRPLANE"], [741, 745, "AIRPLANE"], [861, 865, "AIRPLANE"], [929, 932, "ABBREVIATION"], [1039, 1043, "AIRPLANE"], [1092, 1096, "AIRPLANE"], [1414, 1418, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1487, 1491, "AIRPLANE"], [1687, 1690, "ABBREVIATION"], [1829, 1833, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2265, 2268, "ABBREVIATION"], [2293, 2297, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2341, 2345, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2536, 2541, "CREW"], [3014, 3018, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3055, 3059, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3335, 3339, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3346, 3350, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3397, 3401, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3487, 3491, "AIRPLANE"], [3507, 3514, "AIRPLANE"]]}],

After [the] smoke removal checklist; smoke was removed and did not return. During this process we had contacted dispatch and ATC and arranged for a return to departure airport. We ran the overweight landing QRH and prepared for landing. The Captain landed the aircraft at probably 100 feet per minute.

A hose had been blown off of PAC2. Five to six hose clamps on PAC2 were loose or installed wrong. Also a hose clamp was found in the belly of the plane not connected to anything. PAC1 was inspected and found to have a blown hose as well which was the home of the found hose clamp. Once everything was reinstalled and inspected an ops check was performed on the ground; everything appeared OK so the MEL was removed from PAC1. During climbout a PAC1 overload EICAS was received. The QRH was run for this and cleared the issue. However there was a strong metallic burnt toast smell present with PAC1 running. This issue was written up on arrival.

	["We were scheduled to fly to ZZZ. Upon receiving the release before departure; the weather in ZZZ required an alternate which the dispatcher listed as ZZZ1. However; the forecasted weather at our ETA for ZZZ was 300 overcast which did not meet the requirements for the derived minimums to be a legal alternate. Since we were already fueled; I contacted the dispatcher and inquired why ZZZ1 was listed as an alternate. The dispatcher explained that if we didn't get into ZZZ; he would rather us return to ZZZ1. I explained that was understandable; but ZZZ1 was not a legal alternate. After reviewing the derived minimums with the dispatcher; we selected ZZZ2 as the alternate for dispatch purposes. However; we kept the Pfuel the same so we could divert to ZZZ1 if need be. So in the end; we had two releases; the original release with fuel numbers for the ZZZ1 alternate and the amended release with ZZZ2 listed as an alternate. However we did not change the Pfuel from the original release so we could return to ZZZ1.  Once airborne and approaching ZZZ; my First Officer (FO) picked up the weather via ASOS. I was the flying pilot. He advised me of the weather: 1000 overcast; winds were 12004. The field condition report on the release for ZZZ stated the runway was wet. Please note; prior to departure; the ZZZ winds were forecasted to be only light and variable. After requesting landing data via the ACARS; we saw we did not have the minimum required distance for landing on Runway 27 at our current landing weight. [3kt tailwind component on a wet runway)We were still about 50 miles out and decided to continue in route to see if the winds would shift westerly or abate. We were also very close to having the landing distance and entertained burning roughly 200 lbs to make landing numbers. However; five minutes later; my FO listened to the ASOS again; the winds were now 07004; now a 4kt tailwind. I asked my FO to contact ZZZ operations and verify the runway was indeed wet. ZZZ operations stated the runway was wet. At this point; Center had vectored us onto the localizer. They were aware of our situation; and our runway limitation we were dealing with. I asked the controller if he could verify with tower the runway conditions and winds. He did; ZZZ tower controller advised him the runway was wet and the winds were now 09005. This was now a 5 kt tailwind. At this point; my FO and I determined we could not legally or safely land in ZZZ. We also did not want to compromise our divert fuel by trying to burn the additional fuel to make landing numbers. At that point; we decided to divert due to the current trend of increasing winds shifting to a tailwind on a wet runway. We reviewed the original release and the amended released; verified the fuel on board and fuel burn numbers; and determined we had plenty of fuel to return to ZZZ1 (where our dispatcher wanted us to originally divert to.)During this time; my FO was messaging the dispatcher via the ACARS. His messages essentially explained that we could not land in ZZZ due to a wet runway with the current tailwind component...Runway 9 was not feasible due the ceiling. Additionally; he messaged the dispatcher inquiring if he wanted us to return to ZZZ1 or divert to ZZZ2 . There was a substantial delay in the dispatcher messaging us back which added to the workload and stress. He asked why we were not landing and if something was wrong. He stated the weather he saw showed light and variable winds.  However; he was not getting the true winds from the ASOS and the Tower Controller. He also did not provide us any guidance on where to divert or information outlined [in the] FOM.  He seemed more concerned with rationale as to why we were not landing rather than providing us operational information. After various exchanges with this dispatcher and wasting valuable time; I told my FO to message the dispatcher that we were diverting to ZZZ1 due to winds and a wet runway in ZZZ. Finally; the dispatchermessaged us; 'proceed to ZZZ1...no operational information was appended with the message. Again; we made this decision after reviewing the original release and the amended released; verifying the fuel on board and fuel burn numbers to ZZZ1; and determined we had plenty of fuel to divert to ZZZ1. We landed in safely in ZZZ1with 3200lbs of fuel on board. We made the decision as a crew to divert to ZZZ1: this was a very frustrating and stressful experience that could have been avoided if we had better and faster communication with dispatch. It would have been less stressful if the dispatcher would have assisted with information instead of questioning our rationale while airborne. That took a lot of valuable time. Suggestions: Better training of dispatchers concerning alternate airport requirements and landing performance; improving methods of communication with dispatchers when airborne; the ACARS systems in these aircraft are slow and antiquated; they often loose connectivity when in mountainous terrain...in todays world of smart phones and amazing technology; I am perplexed to why we are still dealing with basic communication issues; dispatchers should assist the crew when airborne; not waste time asking for rationale and explanations about a flight while it is  airborne; there is plenty of time for explanations after the flight safely lands....dispatchers are on the ground and removed from the dynamic and fast changing flight environment; they often do not have the full picture of what is occurring; it is inappropriate for a dispatcher to be questioning and challenging a crew's decision during that time; a crew needs direction; information and assistance.", {"entities": [[82, 89, "WEATHER"], [180, 187, "WEATHER"], [215, 223, "WEATHER"], [1090, 1097, "WEATHER"], [1153, 1160, "WEATHER"], [1167, 1175, "WEATHER"], [3135, 3142, "WEATHER"], [3430, 3437, "WEATHER"], [21, 24, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [195, 198, "ABBREVIATION"], [1037, 1048, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1057, 1070, "CREW"], [1072, 1074, "ABBREVIATION"], [1118, 1124, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1125, 1130, "CREW"], [1256, 1262, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1383, 1390, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1404, 1409, "AIRPLANE"], [1829, 1831, "ABBREVIATION"], [1917, 1919, "ABBREVIATION"], [1961, 1967, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2010, 2016, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2126, 2132, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2213, 2218, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2223, 2229, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2264, 2269, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2297, 2303, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2390, 2392, "ABBREVIATION"], [2441, 2445, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2681, 2687, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2931, 2933, "ABBREVIATION"], [2971, 2976, "AIRPLANE"], [3031, 3035, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3056, 3062, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3380, 3387, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3544, 3549, "CREW"], [3550, 3560, "CREW"], [3722, 3729, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3862, 3864, "ABBREVIATION"], [3945, 3951, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4283, 4289, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4885, 4890, "AIRPLANE"], [5340, 5345, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["Crew Chief delivered a Dangerous Goods Form to crew of dry ice in the aft cargo compartment.  Load closeout received prior to takeoff did NOT reflect the restricted article of the dry ice; but we did not notice it was missing until after departure. Upon reaching initial cruise altitude I noticed the missing item on the load closeout and called operations to confirm whether the dry ice was indeed on board. They checked with the Crew Chief that it was on board and then coordinated with loads to send us an updated load closeout. All of the weights and other numbers were unchanged. The only difference was the YES in the restricted articles aft column. Flight proceeded to ZZZ uneventfully after that.It was late [at] night and it was raining. We were max structural weight and the ATIS takeoff runway had a 10 knot tailwind which made us too heavy to use. We had to coordinate a takeoff runway change.  Because we were so heavy we went over the takeoff data for weight; runway condition; atmospheric conditions carefully and multiple times.

	["Last night we were flying into Montreal; Canada. During the release brief; the Captain went over NOTAMs for Montreal and mentioned the ILS 6L was out of service due to construction. After briefing the weather; we knew there would be possible icing conditions; and the runways could be slick due to snow and ice. Both 6L and 6R were reporting codes of 444. After looking at the runways; we still wanted to use 6L since it was the longer runway; and we were close to a full passenger airplane. Knowing these conditions we decided to plan on the RNAV 6L approach.Flying into CZUL we were assigned the Carter 3 arrival landing 6L and 6R. We were cleared to down to cross and maintain 10;000 feet at EBDOT. After crossing the fix as we were assigned to do; ATC cleared us direct to I believe PEKLO; down to 4;000 and to maintain 250 kts. We were told to expect 6L RNAV like we had planned. As we were trying to get down; we were cleared to join the 6L final approach course. By this point we had flaps 1 in and about to drop the gear to slow down. We were then cleared for the approach and to maintain 3;000 till established. Flaps 2; and 3 were put in and we armed the approach setting 500 for the LNAV/VNAV minimums. The GP then started to drop down and we descended on the approach. We noticed the GP was still quite a bit below us and started to realize we might have to go around. ATC asked us if we were doing okay; due to the fact we looked high on the approach. Since I was flying; the Captain answered back we might have to go around due to possibly not meeting the 1;000 configured requirement. Approach acknowledged and passed us off to Tower. By this point we had reached about 1;500 feet AGL and picked up a little bit of a headwind which slowed us down. We had popped out of the clouds; had visual contact with the runway; we were on GP; and I called for flaps 5. The only thing I noticed was I saw 4 red on the PAPIs. The Captain checked in with Tower and said things were coming together and we could land. Tower then cleared us to land. I pointed out the 4 red PAPIs to him and he agreed we were low; so I disconnected the AP and tried to level off. We never got an EGPWS warning. As we passed through 1;000 we were configured; and at 500 we saw 2 white; 2 red PAPIs with a 800 FPM descent rate. The Captain called stable and we made the landing.On the bus to the hotel; I was rereading the release and the NOTAMs. What happened is the runway was under construction and they displaced the threshold 3;000 feet. In doing so; that's why the ILS 6L was out of service. Reading more of the NOTAMs; one also said the LNAV/VNAV minimums were not authorized either due to a not valid descent angle. That NOTAM was skipped on our brief. Since we followed it down; that's why when we popped out of the clouds we saw 4 red on the PAPIs. Again; we still met the 1;000 configured and 500 stable criteria which lead to a safe landing.What we should have done is to ask ATC to start slowing down sooner due to the shortcut they gave us on the arrival. Then we should have just armed Nav; and used glide path angle to get us down to an MDA. We would have broken out of the clouds with plenty of time to make any adjustments and make a smoother approach.What I learned from this is to double check NOTAMs during our release briefing; and to go over them again during the approach briefing. Also; when flying into an unfamiliar airport; to slow down and make sure everything is set the way I want it to be. Finally; when we realized the GP was below us and something didn't feel right; we can always go around.", {"entities": [[201, 208, "WEATHER"], [242, 247, "WEATHER"], [298, 302, "WEATHER"], [19, 25, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [79, 86, "CREW"], [135, 138, "ABBREVIATION"], [268, 275, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [377, 384, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [436, 442, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [543, 547, "ABBREVIATION"], [551, 559, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [560, 566, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [615, 622, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [680, 691, "ALTITUDE"], [752, 755, "CREW"], [828, 831, "ABBREVIATION"], [859, 863, "ABBREVIATION"], [947, 961, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1072, 1080, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1165, 1173, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1199, 1203, "ABBREVIATION"], [1254, 1263, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1271, 1279, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1370, 1379, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1381, 1384, "CREW"], [1455, 1463, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1477, 1483, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1489, 1496, "CREW"], [1528, 1537, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1600, 1608, "CREW"], [1643, 1648, "CREW"], [1685, 1695, "ALTITUDE"], [1696, 1699, "ABBREVIATION"], [1824, 1830, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1932, 1939, "CREW"], [1956, 1961, "CREW"], [2012, 2016, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2018, 2023, "CREW"], [2043, 2047, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2290, 2293, "ABBREVIATION"], [2294, 2301, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2312, 2319, "CREW"], [2448, 2454, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2501, 2510, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2511, 2521, "ALTITUDE"], [2551, 2554, "ABBREVIATION"], [2629, 2633, "ABBREVIATION"], [2689, 2696, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2709, 2714, "ABBREVIATION"], [2968, 2971, "CREW"], [3241, 3249, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3367, 3375, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3397, 3403, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3595, 3604, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["I was second-in-command; flying pilot. We picked up ATIS information which stated Runway 10R was in use for departure and briefed accordingly. Prior to taxi; we received a new ATIS report which had omitted a runway assignment. The non-flying pilot called for taxi; advised information and that the runway assignment was missing. The Ground Controller said they were fixing that and told us to taxi to Runway 28L via Z hold short of Z1. We read back the instructions and proceeded to taxi onto Z from the ramp. We continued the taxi onto Z1 and did not immediately recognize the hold short markings. We realized too late that we were crossing the hold short line and immediately stopped and advised Ground Control. He advised us to hold position. He then instructed us to continue taxi on Z1; enter the runway and turn left at the first taxiway and hold short of Z1. We complied with no further incident. The Controller asked us to call him when we arrived at our destination and we were cleared for takeoff. We spoke to the Tower [who] advised us that this is a frequent issue with pilots operating at HWD due to the nonstandard location and they were working with the airport to provide a solution. Fortunately the nonstandard location was so far from the end of the runway that there was never a potential conflict with inadvertently entering the runway; however; this also seems to be why it is easily overlooked. In addition; the Z1 taxiway marker is located on the right side of the taxiway and on the opposing left side of the taxiway is a large yellow sign detailing noise abatement procedures for departure off of Runway 28L. This tends to be a big distraction as it pulls your attention to the right side of the taxiway making it easy to pass Z1. As we had anticipated departing [Runway] 10R and received a runway change; it made it all the more easy to focus on the sign and miss the hold. For our debrief we discussed prevention measures for future operations at that location. Being more vigilant with discussing the hot spot locations that could arise from unanticipated taxi routes and a renewed awareness of potential nonstandard signs in use will help to overcome the tendencies to assume understanding of controller instructions.", {"entities": [[25, 31, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [32, 37, "CREW"], [52, 56, "ABBREVIATION"], [176, 180, "ABBREVIATION"], [208, 214, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [242, 247, "CREW"], [298, 304, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [333, 339, "CREW"], [340, 350, "CREW"], [393, 397, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [483, 487, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [504, 508, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [589, 597, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [698, 704, "CREW"], [802, 808, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [836, 843, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [908, 918, "CREW"], [948, 955, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [999, 1006, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1024, 1029, "CREW"], [1082, 1088, "CREW"], [1268, 1274, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1349, 1355, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1437, 1444, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1488, 1495, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1533, 1540, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1721, 1728, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1816, 1822, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2029, 2037, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

There wasn't no radio calls from the pilot coming from the east nor did they state their intention for ZZZ airport. Both planes were within 50 to 100 feet of each other.\nMy student was conducting his first solo flight for private pilot at ZZZ (Non-towered airport). After ensuring student was confident in the airport environment with flight and communications he was endorsed and permitted to conduct his solo.

While approaching the downwind to base leg I observed a second aircraft later observed to be a Cessna 172 enter a long straight-in final for Runway XX from the East. At that time student turned onto his base leg with no indication that either aircraft were aware of the others presence.

	["The airplane FMS decided to leave 13;000 feet while in VNAV mode before reaching the crossing restriction point ZZZZZ at 13;000 [feet]. The next crossing restriction would be ZZZZZ1 at 11;000 feet and 250 Knots. The airplane would have attempted to violate that restriction as well if we had not intervened; by disengaging the autopilot and manually flying the arrival at the proper altitudes. So technically; we flew below one crossing restriction by a couple of hundred feet; but made the rest [by] hand flying the aircraft.This flight leg originated at ZZZ; and was on a quick turn from ZZZ1 and then back to ZZZ1. So the airplane was never completely shut down after arriving in ZZZ. There are over 3;000 software fixes for the FMS in the works from Honeywell; but the release date keeps getting pushed back. In addition there are flight control issues that recently resulted in changes to the Aircraft Flight Manual. 15 emergency procedures involving flight controls were revised to state that the airplane should be landed as soon as possible if a flight control message was displayed on the EICAS. For the Gulfstream; that means at the nearest airport that has an approach if one is required; and a runway that the aircraft can be stopped on.There was also an issue recently with the rudder that has restricted the entire G650 fleet to 250 KIAS until the rudder is modified with a trailing edge strip.Clearly; Gulfstream does not have a handle on their new fly-by-wire technology; their revised FMS software; and the aerodynamics of their Flagship high speed long range aircraft.Many of the changes Gulfstream implemented were driven by the FAA demanding that Gulfstream could not continue to build on their old Type Certificate designs; but to start with a clean sheet designs. If we had shut the airplane down on the ground; to a black aircraft; then restarted; the FMS issues probably [would] not have happened. We will do that on every leg from now on.\nThe reporter stated that due to software fixes not yet implemented by Honeywell; the FMS will allow the aircraft to fly through altitude and speed restrictions. The reporter said the crew does 'not trust the airplane' and 'workarounds must be done all the time'; such as disconnecting the autopilot and FD command bars and using spoilers to control airspeed during programmed descents.The reporter also said that the aircraft QRH has not been updated with new emergency procedures and an Airworthiness Directive because these have not been pushed by Honeywell.

	["It was the third leg out of four on the last day of a four-day trip. The First Officer and I had worked well together throughout. Preflight was normal. We pushed on-time for our flight. During the push we noticed that our takeoff speeds had deleted off the CDU and there was a message stating 'OAT Disagree.' We set the brake; cleared off the Push Crew; and the First Officer told Ramp we'd be delayed a couple minutes. Ramp said to call back when ready to taxi. Both engines were running at this point. Since that speed's deleted situation rarely happens; we discussed it briefly. The First Officer then updated the Takeoff Data and resubmitted it via ACARS. Within seconds we received updated Takeoff Data which we reentered into the FMC. We then reaccomplished the Before Push checklist. The First Officer told ramp we were ready to taxi and they told us to taxi which we did. Both of us had forgotten the Before Taxi Flows and Checklist due to the distraction. While taxiing out; I did a throttle burst which caused the configuration horn and light to activate. It was then we realized we'd forgotten our Before Taxi Flows; Checklist and flaps. We set the flaps to 1 and continued taxi. Prior to takeoff with the aircraft stopped; we completed our Before Taxi Flows and Checklist followed by the Before Takeoff Checklist along with several more throttle bursts. Takeoff and the rest of the flight was uneventful.This was the first time in XX years here I've taxied without flaps. I'm disappointed in myself for allowing it. It was a textbook distraction error straight out of the simulator. There was plenty I could've done better to manage and prevent the situation. First and foremost; I needed to recognize the distraction for what it was and insured we completed our Before Taxi Flows and checklist and then dealt with the takeoff data issue. Then I should've used the Departure Plan Checklist after taxi instead of re-accomplishing the Before Push Checklist after the new data was entered. Lastly; when the configuration horn and light sounded we never referred to the Non-Normal [checklist].

	["While acting as Pilot Monitoring; [on] ILS XXR; all systems were normal; and approach was stable and in the landing configuration [1;500 AGL); we received 'TOO LOW GEAR' at approximately 150 feet AGL. Prior to the GPWS alert; all indications were normal with the before landing checklist completed before 1;000 AGL; both landing gear lights and wheel page on lower ECAM indicated that landing gear was down and locked and GPWS did not annunciate descending through 750 AGL.We got the 'TOO LOW GEAR' warning and executed a go-around at that point. I looked at the lower ECAM and both LGCIU diamonds indicated the landing gear was down; but the normally 'green' landing gear lights were not illuminated. During the go-around; the landing gear retracted normally and all doors closed. During the climbout; we received an 'LGCIU 1' ECAM. The FO flew the airplane and assumed the radios once the go-around was complete and we were in clean configuration 10;000 MSL; 210 KIAS; heading 245 degrees. I ran the ECAM which directed me to turn the GPWS SYS switch the the 'OFF' POSITION.We decided to lower the gear (With LGCIU #2) at 12 miles to give us additional time just in case we had additional issues. When I placed the landing gear down; nothing happened; the landing gear did not extend. Due to our low fuel (approximately 4;000 LBS) status we elected to manually extend the landing gear. The landing gear extended without any lights on the landing gear panel; the lower ECAM indicated 3 green diamonds for LGCIU#2; amber for LGCIU#1; landing gear doors remained extended and 'Steering' was displayed in amber. The landing was uneventful and we slowly taxied to the gate area using differential braking/thrust we elected to be towed into the gate for the last 100 feet.\nOn final approach to Runway XXL at ZZZ we were configured and normal checklists complete according to normal Airbus visual approach profiles. At FAF as Pilot Flying I disengaged the Autopilot and Auto-throttles and hand flew the visual approach. At approximately 200' AGL we received the 'To Low; Gear' Aural Warning. We both noticed that there was no indication; red or green for all three; on the landing gear panel. Even though the gear had initially indicated down and we could hear the gear down we felt a go around was best course of action. CA XX_11 called 'Go Around'.  I initiated the Go around and gear was raised and seemed to work normally. We then received the LGCIU 1 Fault ECAM. At approximately 1000' AGL I reengaged the Autopilot and Auto throttles. CA XX_11 announced I would remain Pilot Flying; also work ATC communications; and he would work the ECAM and checklists. We advised ATC the reason for the go around was a maintenance item. We would need to work a checklist but could go ahead and be vectored for another approach. Checklist for the LGCIU 1 was short and we anticipated the gear would come down normally and we would use the indications on the Lower ECAM Wheel page. We also discussed the loss of Engine 1 thrust reverser and that I would use reverser 2 but only at idle thrust. Also discussed to lower the gear early in case of any further problems. Finals for runway XXL were then 25 to 30 miles in length. Considering fuel levels we planned to lower the gear on a 10 to 15 mile final. I remained Pilot Flying and CA XX_11 resumed ATC communications. When I called for Gear Down and Gear handle was lowered by CA XX_11 nothing happened. There was no change in the indications on the Lower ECAM Wheel page and no normal sound of the gear doors opening and gear lowering. I inquired if there was any mention of a gravity gear extension in the checklist. CA XX_11 said there was not. As Pilot flying I continued to prioritize my attention to flying the approach as CA XX_11 looked at the QRH checklist again; checked system pages and made sure the gear handle was in the proper position. CA XX_11 began the gravity extension and we could hear the gear doors open and verified the gear was down on the Lower ECAM Wheel Page. Touchdown was normal and smooth. Aircraft control was good even with the loss of nose wheel steering and reverser 2 was used at idle thrust. CA XX_11 took command of the aircraft prior to leaving runway center line and was able to steer the aircraft off using differential braking.

	["I am submitting this report because there are similar sounding fixes on the RIKKK4 RNAV departure in Denver. Two fairly similar sounding waypoints on the same departure. There was no course or heading deviation; but we came close due to confusion over a hear-back issue over our initial ATC clearance which was to proceed direct RIKKK. On Departure off of Runway 25; we were expecting the clearance: Runway 25 RNAV MUGBE clear for takeoff; but instead we were given 'on departure fly heading 350 Runway 25 cleared for takeoff. We departed and flew the assigned heading. After several minutes; we were cleared direct to RIKKK as filed. I read back; cleared direct RIKKK; and then looked down at my FMC as I was the Pilot Monitoring and on the bottom of page 1 of my legs page in the FMC I saw the waypoint 'RINKR.' I assumed that was the fix ATC wanted me to fly to thinking that I must have misunderstood the pronunciation of the waypoint ATC wanted us to fly to. As I began to select RINKR; my relief First Officer questioned me and asked if it was RIKKK or RINKR? I Confirmed with ATC and knew it was RIKKK. We selected direct RIKKK and proceeded on course as filed. At no time did we ever turn towards or execute direct RINKR; but very easily could have made this mistake. Please share with ATC for their general awareness that the naming of these two waypoints are too similar. I hope that these fixes may get an updated name sometime in the future to prevent an unnecessary hear back human factors navigational error.", {"entities": [[83, 87, "ABBREVIATION"], [287, 290, "CREW"], [339, 348, "CREW"], [410, 414, "ABBREVIATION"], [431, 438, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [518, 525, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [530, 538, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [543, 547, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [841, 844, "CREW"], [858, 861, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [939, 942, "CREW"], [956, 959, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1002, 1015, "CREW"], [1083, 1086, "CREW"], [1294, 1297, "CREW"]]}],
	["The flight started off two hours and 13 minutes late departing from the gate due to a late inbound aircraft; two unrelated maintenance write-ups and a disruptive passenger. Both the Captain and First Officer had spent the extra time between arriving to the airport and the arrival of the aircraft in the flight planning area reviewing the flight plan as well as reviewing the maintenance log and most of all the MEL that existed on the aircraft due to an inoperative engine anti-ice cowl valve. The Captain and First Officer carefully reviewed the procedures; limitations and restrictions associated with the MEL and the First Officer took notes on a yoke card to make sure all procedures were followed. During this the Captain had debated refusal of the aircraft; as he was concerned about the potential of an existing write-up of the left fuel gauge potentially losing its readout of the quantity. Combined with the potential for uneven fuel burn due to the MEL on the left engine anti-ice cowl the Captain was concerned about having to do a precautionary divert during the flight if the fuel gauge went blank and fuel balance could not be determined. After a discussion with the Dispatcher; both the Captain and the First Officer felt comfortable with the plan and proceeded to the gate to see what the mechanics onboard the aircraft who were working on the inbound write-ups had to say.After the aircraft was boarded and all the briefings were completed; the flight deck crew completed their checklists and called for pushback from the gate. The aircraft was pushed to a spot in the alley where a cross-bleed start could be accomplished and both engines were started in accordance with the MEL and the supplementary procedure for a cross-bleed start. The aircraft taxied out to Runway XX at intersection X. All checklists were accomplished and other than performing a normal thrust takeoff per the MEL; the takeoff was normal and uneventful as planned.Right about at acceleration altitude of 818 ft. MSL as the First Officer was calling for the thrust reduction by using VNAV (something that was briefed prior due to the late night with fewer aircraft and the likelihood of ZZZ TRACON offering a higher altitude very quickly as they often do) the aircraft began to bang very loudly and the First Officer felt the aircraft begin to yaw and roll to the right. The First Officer who was the pilot flying stopped the yaw and roll using the left rudder and began to call out the single engine profile from the position in the profile the flight had reached. Obviously; the ability to recall exactly what happened in those short few moments when the engine first started having compressor stalls is very hard to recall and it cannot be overemphasized enough how much was happening at once. The need prioritize flying the aircraft became the primary focus; especially for the pilot flying. There was some confusion with the altitude that was assigned vs. what was set in the window however ATC did not seem to worry as long as the aircraft remained at or above 2;500 ft. MSL. Once the aircraft was cleaned up and the initial QRC was run the right engine was back at idle and the crew was able to divide tasks so the First Officer was flying and talking to ATC while the Captain ran the QRH and communicated in and out of the aircraft.Overall; CRM was a focus for the remainder of the flight as the First Officer continued to keep the Captain aware of their position and altitude relative to the ZZZ airport while the Captain kept the First Officer in the loop on his progress in the QRH and the decisions he was making. The crew chose not to shut down the right engine as the compressor stall had gone away and the only indication of a problem with the right engine was the recorded 900-degree ITT over temp. N1; N2 and N3 were all rotating at idle normally from the crew's perspective. The crew chose to leave the right engine a t idle and perform a single engine landing. CRM was at its highest when initial decisions of auto-brake use and runway choice for example were revised after the crew discussed the initial decision. The aircraft left ATC vectors to begin a right 12-mile base leg at 2;500 feet for the ILS Runway XX. The aircraft landed at flaps 20 in the single engine configuration with the left engine operating normally and the right engine at idle with auto brakes of two. The controls were transferred to the Captain on the base leg and the Captain performed the landing. The Captain intentionally flew the aircraft visually slightly below glideslope in order to take full advantage of the full touchdown distance with the unusual configuration. The left reverser was opened to full and the Captain immediately started manually braking the aircraft to a taxi speed. The aircraft exited at the end of the runway where rescue vehicles met the aircraft to inspect for any condition that would not allow for a safe taxi back to the gate. Once the all clear was given the aircraft was taxied back to the gate safely and deplaned normally through the jet way.", {"entities": [[53, 62, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [72, 76, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [123, 134, "CREW"], [182, 189, "CREW"], [194, 207, "CREW"], [241, 249, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [376, 387, "CREW"], [467, 473, "AIRPLANE"], [499, 506, "CREW"], [511, 524, "CREW"], [621, 634, "CREW"], [651, 655, "AIRPLANE"], [720, 727, "CREW"], [976, 982, "AIRPLANE"], [1001, 1008, "CREW"], [1203, 1210, "CREW"], [1219, 1232, "CREW"], [1285, 1289, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1522, 1530, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1540, 1544, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1768, 1774, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1795, 1807, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1886, 1893, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1911, 1918, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1996, 2002, "ALTITUDE"], [2004, 2007, "ABBREVIATION"], [2015, 2028, "CREW"], [2075, 2079, "ABBREVIATION"], [2182, 2188, "ABBREVIATION"], [2294, 2307, "CREW"], [2366, 2379, "CREW"], [2392, 2397, "CREW"], [2485, 2491, "AIRPLANE"], [2648, 2654, "AIRPLANE"], [2808, 2814, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2873, 2878, "CREW"], [2879, 2885, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2972, 2978, "AIRPLANE"], [2987, 2990, "CREW"], [3058, 3066, "ALTITUDE"], [3068, 3071, "ABBREVIATION"], [3144, 3150, "AIRPLANE"], [3213, 3226, "CREW"], [3231, 3237, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3253, 3256, "CREW"], [3267, 3274, "CREW"], [3283, 3286, "ABBREVIATION"], [3395, 3408, "CREW"], [3431, 3438, "CREW"], [3514, 3521, "CREW"], [3531, 3544, "CREW"], [3580, 3583, "ABBREVIATION"], [3659, 3665, "AIRPLANE"], [3756, 3762, "AIRPLANE"], [3918, 3924, "AIRPLANE"], [3955, 3961, "AIRPLANE"], [4039, 4045, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4143, 4146, "CREW"], [4180, 4188, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4192, 4202, "ALTITUDE"], [4211, 4214, "ABBREVIATION"], [4239, 4245, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4272, 4278, "AIRPLANE"], [4307, 4313, "AIRPLANE"], [4347, 4353, "AIRPLANE"], [4424, 4431, "CREW"], [4439, 4447, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4456, 4463, "CREW"], [4491, 4498, "CREW"], [4513, 4517, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4610, 4619, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4706, 4713, "CREW"], [4819, 4825, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4943, 4947, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4995, 5001, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5014, 5018, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

Tower had advised us that we had a wheels up time in 3-5min. My First Officer alerted the Tower that we were probably not going to make the time due to our slow taxi and poor taxiway conditions. I had noted a slight improvement to taxi conditions but became wary when I saw a downslope. I slowed down to a crawl before entering the downslope and lost all directional control due to unreported nil braking action and a 41 kt wind pushing us clockwise. I tried my best to stop the skid but the wind and ice had conspired against us. We came to a rest when our left main gained traction on the grass and we had gone off the taxiway about 6 inches. I then shut down both engines and coordinated to safely remove passengers to the terminal and find a way to pull the airplane out of the grass. There were no injuries; no aircraft damage; and no airport damage reported.Inadequate taxiway friction reports led the crew to believe that they could continue to taxi to a runway when they should have picked an alternate route due to unreported NIL braking action. The crew taxied slowly and used a two engine taxi [in accordance with] policy. Alternate methods were used in order to accomplish tasks that required good braking action (clearing engines after deice; taking care of most tasks while not moving to limit heads down operations).After the event; airport operations promptly came to the area where the incident occurred and spent some time sanding down and salting the taxiway. This proved that they did not accurately report the braking action and were trying to cover their tracks before airport police and other officials came. Even after the taxiways were sanded and salted; the emergency vehicles were still sliding around and the officers were struggling to maintain traction while documenting the events.\nVery slow taxi ~3-4mph; Medium-poor braking reported on the field. While on '[Taxiway X]' ATC ground control advised us of a release time [that was only] 5 minutes from current time. Crew advised ATC that due to slow taxiing there was the possibility that window would not be made due to taxi conditions. While taxiing the plane was brought to a complete stop multiple times to ensure adequate braking. A slight downhill was encountered; the plane was slowed to a crawl to ensure safety. At that point the wind weather-vaned the aircraft perpendicular to the taxiway; braking was found to be nil; and the plane slid back to a stop. The left main outboard tire left the taxiway and settled on the grass ~6inches.ATC was notified that we would be unable to continue and would need a tug to move the aircraft. Station operations; Company; and ATC were notified of the situation. Airport operations started continually salting the taxiway after the excursion. Operations arrived with a bus for the passengers who were deplaned and transported to the terminal safely. The plane was tugged out by maintenance and returned to the gate safely. No crew or passengers were injured and there was no apparent damage to the aircraft or airport facilities.", {"entities": [[492, 504, "WEATHER"], [706, 710, "WEATHER"], [1404, 1408, "WEATHER"], [1472, 1476, "WEATHER"], [3299, 3303, "WEATHER"], [3304, 3311, "WEATHER"], [147, 162, "AIRPLANE"], [311, 318, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [355, 361, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [436, 440, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [718, 722, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [765, 769, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [800, 807, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [838, 844, "AIRPLANE"], [845, 851, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [940, 944, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [980, 985, "CREW"], [1044, 1057, "CREW"], [1070, 1075, "CREW"], [1155, 1162, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1571, 1576, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1601, 1608, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1706, 1714, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1762, 1767, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1855, 1862, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1932, 1936, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1942, 1948, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2044, 2050, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2073, 2079, "AIRPLANE"], [2450, 2457, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2883, 2886, "CREW"], [2989, 2992, "CREW"], [3049, 3055, "AIRPLANE"], [3104, 3111, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3352, 3359, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3462, 3469, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3489, 3494, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3504, 3507, "CREW"], [3633, 3636, "CREW"], [3720, 3727, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3760, 3767, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3839, 3847, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3884, 3895, "CREW"], [3916, 3920, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],
	["We had a normal flight and landing. During our inflight arrival and performance planning there were no indications that any icing conditions existed at [the] airport. Stall protections speeds were utilized due to the common indication from flying through clouds in cold weather flying. Upon landing; runways and taxiways appeared to be completely clear of ice and snow other than a very thin layer of snow in the grass.Just after discontinuing reverse thrust at approximately 80 kts. I transferred controls to [the] Captain. He continued to slow the aircraft and exited at the intersection. Our estimated ground speed was between 5-10 kts. I hadn't yet turned off any lights and our visibility of the runway exit was good. The intersection appeared to be free of snow and ice. The aircraft was almost completely clear of [the] runway when it began to slide; which we suspect was from black ice. [The] Captain attempted to prevent the slide into the grass with continued brake application. We cut the corner of the grass bay and continued to slide onto [the] taxiway where the aircraft regained traction.[The] Captain assessed our taxi capability while I contacted Tower to inform them of the danger and our departure from the taxiway. Captain was confident in the aircraft's capability to taxi so we continued to the gate.

As we entered the ramp on the Charlie line from the south port the Captain verbalized the threat of vehicle traffic crossing in front of the aircraft as we approached the gate because there is a busy vehicle traffic lane running adjacent to the B terminal. We scanned out of our respective sides of the aircraft and identified multiple vehicles approaching to pass in front of our gate.As we were approximately one half airplane length from crossing the vehicle lane and with marshalers in position we expected to see the approaching vehicles slow and stop. Instead the first of the few; a tow vehicle with baggage cart in tow; accelerated to pass in front of us. We were at a slow speed but the Captain braked to yield and bring us to a stop. Now more cautious the Captain resumed a slow taxi and we observed a larger tow vehicle with large trailer in tow accelerate to pass in front of us. The Captain braked again and a third baggage tow vehicle raced in front of us.We identified the safety infractions to ramp and the Ramp Controller confirmed that she observed the actions of the ground traffic and was on the phone; presumably to pass feedback.

Saw [a] very large cruise ship steaming from left to right out of harbor with course that would cross the short final in front of Runway 35. It appeared to me that the ship's vector would cross ours on a very short final 1 mile. I directed the First Officer to query the Tower if this ship was going to be a problem with our final. The Tower's answer was something like '...they (the ships) don't coordinate with us.' I elected to fly high on the final glide path; approximately one dot high; to ensure adequate clearance over the cruise ship but was also considering a go-around because of the height of the ship. It turned out that we did; in fact; cross directly over the ship on short final. If I had stayed on the ILS glideslope the clearance would have been very uncomfortable. Had this been IMC conditions and with any deviation at all below the glideslope; there may have been inadequate clearance over the ship.

	["This occurrence happened on the first day of a three-day trip. We accepted the aircraft after it had been in the hanger the entire day. Upon pushback for the first leg; we received an oil pressure warning accompanied by the aural upon starting engine 1. I remember we accidentally did not start engine 1 first as we should do during first flights. We had started with engine 2 first. I only realized and pointed out the error during the engine 2 start sequence. The Captain elected to do a fuel feed check valve test on engine two. We deselected the fuel pumps and got pump press annunciations on engine 2. Then; we started [engine] 1. Oil pressure spiked beyond the arc to around 120. We got an engine oil pressure warning which didn't stop even after oil pressure settled in the green. The captain then shut down engine 1. We pulled back to the gate and maintenance did several checks and signed off the aircraft. We then re boarded and completed the first leg with no incident.  On my post flight at the out station; it was apparent there was a significant layer of freezing rain that had built up on the aircraft including a thin layer on the spinners of the engines. I notified the Captain and we looked at it together and called Maintenance to see how to remove ice from such a sensitive area. The Captain informed me Maintenance advised the run up would clear the ice.  We taxied over the deice pad but had to wait about an hour for another aircraft to get deiced. During that time the Captain shut down engine 1 and ran the APU for air conditioning to save fuel. Before pulling into the pad; we started engine 1 again and dropped the APU.  We ran the deice checklist engines running and deiced with no issues. I would add the deice personnel seemed a little inexperienced; getting confused with our call sign and mis-reading the deice times to us once complete. We ran the rest of the checklist including the run up. We took off bleeds closed with the APU supplying air for the packs. After takeoff; during the after-landing flow; I swapped the bleeds to the engine and dropped the APU. Around 2 minutes after takeoff I noticed thick black smoke billowing out of the graspers in the cockpit. It smelled like burning plastic. I told the captain I was going on o2. We established mask communications and we discussed the situation and decided to go back to the out station; since it was so close and familiar. We didn't want to be airborne longer than necessary. I [requested priority handling] with departure at that point. The Captain transferred controls to me; and I flew and handled ATC communications. We descended to the MSA and I got delay vectors for the ILS while the Captain ran the QRH; gave the Flight Attendant a [report] and sent a quick message to Dispatch. We were experiencing moderate turbulence; ice; and freezing rain in flight while being vectored; weather was about 400 feet or so above minimums. Once the Captain was done with his duties; we turned back inbound and we decided it would be best if the Captain took the landing. We shot the ILS without incident and landed; taxied back to the gate; and deplaned. I'm not sure what caused this event. We did the deice checklist correctly and configured for deicing correctly. The smoke came after swapping bleeds to the engine so maybe it was a pack malfunction or deice fluid somehow burned and entered the air conditioning.

	["Contract stations always perform well and usually have the flight ready to depart early (up to 10 minutes). This pushes the Crew into an expectation to hustle with the potential for errors. RIC Airport is still living in the analog world which is not understandable in my mind. This is not some backwater airport in an underfunded area. This is the capital of VA for goodness sake. Without digital ATIS inbound flights can not properly plan or brief the arrival; landing and taxi as soon as possible if they were to join the digital world. There are numerous runways and the option for RNP approaches to be utilized as RIC can be accommodating in our requests.For Departures; my biggest area of concern in the under-staffing in the Tower for early morning originators. The many times I have worked the RIC-ZZZ (X:00) AM flight it has been ready to push 10 minutes early and even leaving the maximum of five minutes early places you into a busy 'ATC' induced environment. This is caused by many factors; first with only one Controller on duty who has to make an analog ATIS; give clearances by voice (lack of PDC or CPDLC) call for release to ZZZ and ZZZ1 airports; provide and monitor taxi instructions; provide and monitor local instructions. Each time I have experienced one (other carrier X) flight taxiing while the lone Controller must be giving out clearances to two (carrier Y) flights; calling for release on one of them. A new ATIS should be produced but not possible due to the workload. Then our flight is caught up in the fray by needing its normal services. Many flights request a preferred runway which is not always the same.This last week with the visibility low ground position reports were required as we had to cross two runways on the way to the active. One of which other flights were using. Clearly this is going to result in an incident or accident because one individual can not possibly wear that many hats. Staff the Tower properly; and get into the digital world. There are several airports still not utilizing digital ATIS; PDC and CPDLC. Unacceptable! Having the Controller combine Ground and Tower on one frequency while using clearance in another is troublesome. There is no way to know when they are issuing or hearing a readback while trying to call for taxi or takeoff. Any interruption to them leads to potential errors many of which could be catastrophic. As for me; I will never push early again. So allowing an ontime push; the other three flights will be on their way and the Controller can give us full and their undivided attention. Each time our flight has arrived in ZZZ up to 20 minutes early so leaving on time will still allow for an acceptable arrival time. I would expect an immediate Safety Alerts to all Pilots; many of which do not get to RIC frequently enough to be aware of this issue and second immediately explain the danger to the RIC contract staff to really push on time and not early. I'm sure they feel the pressure from XXX to perform or be replaced.", {"entities": [[1664, 1674, "WEATHER"], [2967, 2975, "WEATHER"], [75, 81, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [360, 362, "ABBREVIATION"], [398, 402, "ABBREVIATION"], [475, 479, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [559, 566, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [590, 600, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [732, 737, "CREW"], [945, 948, "CREW"], [1023, 1033, "CREW"], [1068, 1072, "ABBREVIATION"], [1302, 1309, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1325, 1335, "CREW"], [1436, 1440, "ABBREVIATION"], [1604, 1610, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1740, 1747, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1943, 1948, "CREW"], [2046, 2050, "ABBREVIATION"], [2092, 2102, "CREW"], [2111, 2117, "CREW"], [2122, 2127, "CREW"], [2295, 2302, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2515, 2525, "CREW"], [2599, 2606, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["During a repositioning flight departing from ZZZ climbing through 15;000 ft.; the First Officer and I noticed that the cabin altitude displayed 8;800 ft. in amber and was climbing slowly. We were cleared to 17;000 ft.; and upon reaching; the cabin aural warning had just gone off and the displayed altitude of 10;500 ft. was in red. Upon noticing this; we coordinated with ATC to descend to 15;000 ft. in order to help with the pressurization. Reaching 15;000 ft.; we ran the QRH and determined that the manual controller knob was not in the auto position (full left); but was closer to the dump position. After correcting the knob's position back to auto; the plane began to re-pressurize. We stayed at 15;000 ft. for a few minutes to assist with the pressurization and once it achieved safe levels; we began a slow climb to our final altitude of 21;000 ft.. We then continued the flight with constant monitoring of the system and no further issues.The issue was detected by the flight crew during climb out and noticing that the cabin altitude on the EICAS was abnormal.The cause of this event was due both pilots missing items at certain points. During the FO's final cockpit scan; the landing field elevation was selected but the knob's position was not fully verified. Also; during climb out and the after takeoff checklist; the Pilot Monitoring didn't effectively check the pressurization.The Flight Crew reacted appropriately to the issue by leveling off to troubleshoot; descending to help with the pressurization; and running the QRH and discovering the problem. We also continued to monitor the situation for the remainder of the flight.There are certainly a few things to suggest here. First; it is vitally important that both crew members thoroughly review everything all the time; especially with a plane that has just come out of maintenance. Second; it is equally important to make sure checklists are run to their completion - meaning that the expanded portions of the checklists are also adhered to. Lastly; I would suggest that; if possible; Maintenance goes over the actions taken and switches moved with the Flight Crew before a repo flight leaves any station. While it is the responsibility of the crew to conduct a safe and compliant flight; it is often assumed that maintenance has done their best to leave the plane as a crew would receive it on the line. Sometimes there are switches and lights out of place; but I have never experienced an item as important as pressurization until now.

	["We received the aircraft on leg two. When we set thrust for takeoff; up until about 1;000 feet we smelled an exhaust like odor. It was momentary and did not persist. We weren't sure if it was a deciding fluid smell. We smelt it again on the second takeoff; again only from thrust set to about 1;000 feet and wondered if it may be associated with air from Pack 1. Because it was momentary we did not believe it to be a threat to safety of flight. On flight 3 we took off with Pack 1 off and still had some odor; uncommon to be associated with deciding fluid. We agreed to call Maintenance when we landed in ZZZ. When we landed I called Maintenance and explained the situation; they indicated that ZZZ was not a Maintenance base and told me they'd need to call contract out or have Maintenance drive from ZZZ1 to look at the aircraft if I wrote it up and asked if I was willing to simulate a takeoff to see if the odor was present. We went to simulate a takeoff and noted no odor. We went back to the gate and notified Maintenance and agreed that we were mutually satisfied there was no issue. I left a note on the yoke for the morning crew to notify them of the smell during takeoffs.Suggestions: The following day I was notified that the aircraft cleaners were unwilling to clean the aircraft because of the note of odor I left for the crew. As a result from what I understand; Maintenance were called to the aircraft; despite no write up or open discrepancies. The note was intended as useful information to the next crew. During the initial call Maintenance were quick to tell me the implications of a write up (calling contract or sending Maintenance from ZZZ1) and were keen to find an alternative. I believe if we had made the write up from when I first called the situation would have been handled more appropriately. I was using my best judgment for the run up and was satisfied with the outcome but also had my best intentions in mind by leaving the crew an indication of something they might encounter during their flight considering there was no documentation of the issue or the successful run up.

	["The morning could be described as cold (temp in the teens F); with blowing snow out of the west. The airplane had been sitting on the ramp since the Captain and I brought it into ZZZ from ZZZ1. The Captain was the flying pilot and I was the pilot monitoring for this leg. There was a late push back due to delayed loading of cargo. It was a normal push back until there was an impending hot start on the right engine. No parameters were exceeded; and the fuel control switch was moved to cutoff. We waited until the EGT cooled back down and initiated another start. The Captain moved the igniters from 1 to both for the second attempt. We let the engine motor for 1 min to clear out any fuel and to ensure the EGT was cool enough. During the second attempt the right engine started as normal. There was a normal start on the left engine following the second start on the right engine. No other abnormalities occurred until the top of descent.We were given a crossing restriction and a decent via the ZZZZZ arrival. We were at FL 350 and already in the VNAV path; so the Captain set the altitude bug to 6;000 ft.; the final altitude over ZZZZZ. We then monitored the aircraft's progress until the airplane crossed the top of descent and began descending via the arrival. Once the engines were brought back via the auto throttles there was a loud bang and some vibrations in the airframe. The Captain asked Captain A; who was dead heading; to check the cargo to see if there was a shift in any of the containers. As the Captain was checking the cargo load; I was checking the paperwork to see if any open spots were noted. Captain A returned saying cargo was loaded in the front two spots and the paperwork confirmed that only the rear spot in the belly was void. The rest of the descent and arrival went without any other abnormalities; until the transition to approach.We were cleared direct ZZZZZ1 after ZZZZZ. The FMS was loaded and the LNAV followed the course. After crossing ZZZZZ at 6;000 ft.; we were cleared to 4;000 ft. We leveled at 4;000 ft. and then were cleared to cross ZZZZZ1 at or above 2;400 ft. cleared for the ILS XXL approach. The Captain selected 2;400 ft. on the altitude bug and armed the approach. Once the throttles were brought back via the autothrottles the banging and vibrations began again. This time they were continuous and more violent. The Captain disconnected the auto pilot and stated something was abnormal with the handling of the aircraft. He then [advised ATC] and headed direct for the runway. The Captain noted the large difference between the left and right engine indications although both throttles were matched in the flight deck. The Captain asked for the right engine to be shut down and the immediate action checklist severe engine damage. I grabbed the immediate action checklist card and began running the severe damage checklist. All three of use confirmed and shut down the right engine. After completion of the checklist all of our attention was focused on the approach and landing the aircraft. After landing and vacating the runway; emergency vehicles inspected the airplane and stated that the RAM air turbine was deployed; but no damage or fire was noted. After inspection; the Captain requested an after-landing flow and taxied back to the gate single engine. Upon arrival at the gate and engine shut down; a walk around of the airplane was conducted by all three pilots. No damage was detected; and the only abnormality was the RAT being deployed.Weather conditions on the arrival were fair. We experienced some light chop between 17;500 ft. and 15;500 ft. Weather conditions at the field were steady state winds around 10 kts. out of the northwest and good visibility.", {"entities": [[67, 79, "WEATHER"], [1671, 1676, "WEATHER"], [3718, 3728, "WEATHER"], [134, 138, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [149, 156, "CREW"], [198, 205, "CREW"], [214, 220, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [221, 226, "CREW"], [241, 246, "CREW"], [410, 416, "AIRPLANE"], [516, 519, "ABBREVIATION"], [570, 577, "CREW"], [647, 653, "AIRPLANE"], [710, 713, "ABBREVIATION"], [767, 773, "AIRPLANE"], [830, 836, "AIRPLANE"], [877, 883, "AIRPLANE"], [934, 941, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1026, 1028, "ABBREVIATION"], [1052, 1056, "ABBREVIATION"], [1070, 1077, "CREW"], [1102, 1110, "ALTITUDE"], [1224, 1231, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1242, 1252, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1377, 1385, "AIRPLANE"], [1391, 1398, "CREW"], [1405, 1412, "CREW"], [1518, 1525, "CREW"], [1621, 1628, "CREW"], [1778, 1785, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1860, 1868, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1916, 1919, "ABBREVIATION"], [1989, 1997, "ALTITUDE"], [2019, 2027, "ALTITUDE"], [2043, 2051, "ALTITUDE"], [2103, 2111, "ALTITUDE"], [2129, 2132, "ABBREVIATION"], [2137, 2145, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2151, 2158, "CREW"], [2168, 2176, "ALTITUDE"], [2212, 2220, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2374, 2381, "CREW"], [2404, 2409, "CREW"], [2496, 2499, "CREW"], [2527, 2533, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2539, 2546, "CREW"], [2601, 2607, "AIRPLANE"], [2681, 2688, "CREW"], [2709, 2715, "AIRPLANE"], [2774, 2780, "AIRPLANE"], [2933, 2939, "AIRPLANE"], [3015, 3023, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3028, 3035, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3056, 3063, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3081, 3087, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3159, 3166, "AIRPLANE"], [3236, 3243, "CREW"], [3263, 3270, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3280, 3286, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3299, 3303, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3311, 3317, "AIRPLANE"], [3339, 3343, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3348, 3354, "AIRPLANE"], [3423, 3429, "CREW"], [3591, 3600, "ALTITUDE"], [3606, 3615, "ALTITUDE"], [3683, 3686, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

	["We were cleared direct to BLAYQ and the FILPZ3 STAR. The FA (Flight Attendant) and myself verified all of the waypoints and constraints in the FMS against the STAR chart; everything was correct. We were cleared to descend via the arrival landing South. The FO (First Officer) put in 6000 ft. into the Alt select and I selected VNAV on the autopilot guidance panel; we confirmed all selections per SOP. There was approximately a 90 knot tailwind when the airplane began the descent from FL350 following the vertical profile of the arrival in VNAV. There is a 270 kts speed restriction at PHAYE. I noticed the airplane was not decelerating quick enough to meet the restriction and selected Airbrakes 1. The airplane was still fast so I selected PATH on the guidance panel and leveled the airplane off to aid the slow down. Once we were slowed to 270 KIAS I used the PATH function to select a decent that would re-intercept the FMS calculated decent profile; but I didn't re-arm VNAV. This was done intentionally because our VNAV in such situations will command a very aggressive descent to recapture the profile. My intent was to wait until we were close to the calculated path again before re-arming VNAV to avoid the excessive descent angle. I used our Vertical Situation Display to select a path angle that would re-intercept the FMS profile just prior to crossing CEDOX at 9000 ft. MSL. I kept my finger on the VNAV button to remind me of the need to re-select it. However; due to the continued strong tailwind and descent angle I had to remove my hand from the VNAV select button and use the hand to continually actuate the air brakes so as to meet the speed restrictions on the STAR. I became distracted from the VNAV as I focused on meeting the 210 kts speed restriction at CEDOX. During this time the PM (Pilot MOnitoring) was changing our assigned runway from the expected ILS Runway 36R to the ILS Runway 36L. The PM verified my PATH selection was appropriate prior to re-programming the FMS and we re-briefed the changes to the approach and runway. At some point prior to crossing CEDOX the airplane path descended below the FMS calculated profile because I had failed re-arm VNAV on the guidance panel and was still descending in PATH which will only honor the Altitude Selection [6000 ft.) and not the FMS profile. I was concentrating modulating the air brakes to comply with the 210 kts. constraint at CEDEX and failed to recognize that we were significantly below the 9000 ft. restriction. Approach control notified us of our failure to comply with the restriction and issued a descent to 5000 ft. The rest of the approach and arrival was normal from that point forward. In hindsight; I allowed myself to become distracted enough by the speed constraints that I failed to monitor the vertical profile close enough. I should have re-armed VNAV and not have decided to wait until the airplane was closer to the calculated descent profile.", {"entities": [[431, 435, "WEATHER"], [47, 51, "ABBREVIATION"], [143, 146, "ABBREVIATION"], [159, 163, "ABBREVIATION"], [214, 221, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [238, 245, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [257, 259, "ABBREVIATION"], [261, 274, "CREW"], [283, 290, "ALTITUDE"], [327, 331, "ABBREVIATION"], [339, 348, "AIRPLANE"], [473, 480, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [486, 491, "ALTITUDE"], [541, 545, "ABBREVIATION"], [562, 565, "ABBREVIATION"], [925, 928, "ABBREVIATION"], [976, 980, "ABBREVIATION"], [1022, 1026, "ABBREVIATION"], [1077, 1084, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1199, 1203, "ABBREVIATION"], [1227, 1234, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1331, 1334, "ABBREVIATION"], [1375, 1382, "ALTITUDE"], [1384, 1387, "ABBREVIATION"], [1413, 1417, "ABBREVIATION"], [1517, 1524, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1564, 1568, "ABBREVIATION"], [1682, 1686, "ABBREVIATION"], [1717, 1721, "ABBREVIATION"], [1754, 1757, "ABBREVIATION"], [1855, 1861, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1880, 1883, "ABBREVIATION"], [1902, 1905, "ABBREVIATION"], [1996, 1999, "ABBREVIATION"], [2037, 2045, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2050, 2056, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2114, 2123, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2134, 2137, "ABBREVIATION"], [2185, 2189, "ABBREVIATION"], [2226, 2236, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2291, 2298, "ALTITUDE"], [2313, 2316, "ABBREVIATION"], [2395, 2398, "ABBREVIATION"], [2481, 2488, "ALTITUDE"], [2503, 2511, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2591, 2598, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2602, 2609, "ALTITUDE"], [2627, 2635, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2851, 2855, "ABBREVIATION"], [2933, 2940, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["The mission was to do an IFR cross-country to this airport for dinner and return all at night. The student has hundreds of hours of experience in the aircraft type and is well versed. I was the CFI for the flight and have plenty of experience in the type of aircraft.Upon arrival at the airport on Runway XX the left main tire of the Cessna 172 blew due to unknown circumstances and yawed to the left. I took the controls from the student and applied right rudder and came to a stop. After stopping about 2;500 ft. in and about 30 ft. left of the runway centerline we shut down and observed the damage to the tire. The aircraft could not be moved. Considering it was nighttime; the student remained with the airplane and left the strobes/nav lights on while I looked for assistance.

I did however; remain by the aircraft to advise other pilots on the CTAF of the airplane on the runway. This posed a massive safety hazard as in the 2.5 hours the airplane was on the runway multiple pilots attempted an approach to Runway 22 and executed a go-around after hearing of the issue on the radio. I received a call from the airport manager; on his personal phone; that Flight Service had called him regarding the incident and to keep him updated. At 10 pm local; my mechanic flew in and replaced the tire and I flew the airplane back home.Looking back; the aircraft on the runway was nearly impossible to see since it was night time and posed a major hazard to landing aircraft.

	["While being vectored for Visual Approach to Runway XX at ZZZ; the First Officer called for Flaps 5. I set the Flap Handle to 5 and about the same time ATC called our base turn. It was shortly afterward that I realized the flaps had barely moved; even though the handle was in the 5 detent. The indicators were split; 1 at 0; and the other at about 1/2 degree (I don't recall L/R). I pointed this out to the First Officer and we agreed to abandon the approach and work the problem through the QRH. While being vectored by ATC; we referenced the Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry Checklist. This checklist directed us to bring the flap handle back to the Up position; which in turn led us to the Trailing Edge Flaps Up Landing Checklist. At that point I made sure the First Officer had the flight controls and ATC; and I contacted Dispatch/Maintenance through ZZZ OPS frequency. I informed them of our condition and told them we would probably need to divert to ZZZ1 in order to have a longer runway. We began to run weight and balance numbers and brake cooling data for Runway XY at ZZZ1. Dispatch was doing the same; but also ran numbers for Runway XX at ZZZ. They informed us that we would have a stopping margin of about 1;500 ft. with Autobrake Max. We went ahead and confirmed this by running the numbers ourselves; but neither one of us was comfortable landing on the shorter runway because we also had the Number 2 thrust reverser inoperative. This was something that was already on an MEL. Another big concern was brake cooling and potential for blowing tire fuse plugs.We both felt like the safest and most conservative choice was the longer runway at ZZZ1. I was fully aware that it would be inconvenient for everyone involved but had to remind myself of our operational priorities and their order. Dispatch; ATC; Flight Attendants; and Passengers were all fully informed of our situation. We [requested priority handling] with ATC and requested vectors for a 25 mile final to give us time to finish the QRH procedures which required us to deploy the leading edge flaps via the alternate method. I assumed control of the aircraft about 35 miles from the airport. We finished the QRH and made the high speed approach and landing on Runway XY without incident. CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) was waiting and we had them inspect the tires and brakes. They noted nothing of concern and based on my brake application at about 130 kts.; we were able to proceed to a gate that had been coordinated for us. On shutdown we noted low B-system quantity of 74 and an RF displayed. Defects were entered in the logbook and per coordination from the Operations Center; the passengers and crew eventually deplaned; cleared Immigration and Customs; and boarded ground transportation for ZZZ.This was just an unfortunate flap malfunction. I don't think it was preventable.\nWhile on downwind; descending through 3;500 ft. to 2;000 ft. for Visual Approach to Runway XX into ZZZ; we attempted to configured to flaps 5. One flap did not move and the other flap extended to about a half of a degree. We coordinated with ATC to level off at 3;000 ft. and got vectors while we worked the problem. We started with the Trailing Edge Flap Asymmetry Checklist. This checklist drove us to move the flap handle back to 'Up'. The flaps remained in an asymmetric condition so; per the QRH; we transitioned to the Trailing Edge Flaps Up Landing Checklist. At that point; the Captain began coordinating with Dispatch; while the First Officer continued to fly. After looking at the performance and brake cooling data at both ZZZ and ZZZ1; we decided to divert to ZZZ1 in order to land on a longer runway. Although we had the performance data to land at ZZZ; given the combination of the no flap landing and #2 thrust reverser MEL (inherited from a previous flight) doing so would have required a max braking effort; longer brake cooling period (over one hour) and ultimately a smaller margin of safety. We coordinated with ATC to fly a 25 mile visual straight in to Runway XY at ZZZ1. Additionally; we [requested priority handling with ATC]; coordinated with Dispatch; and informed the passengers and flight attendants of the situation. We finished the Trailing Edge Flaps Up Landing Checklist; deploying the leading edge devices through the alternate flaps extension procedure; and the Captain landed on Runway XY; applying brakes at about 130 kts. We taxied off the runway; had the emergency vehicles check the brake temperatures (which they assessed as normal); and uneventfully taxied to the gate. At the gate; we noticed that the number 2 hydraulic quantity was low (the quantity indicated about 75 with an 'RF' annotated). Neither this condition nor any other hydraulic abnormality alerted throughout the flight. After coordinating for Customs and offline support; we ended the flight without further incident.", {"entities": [[32, 40, "CREW"], [66, 79, "CREW"], [151, 154, "CREW"], [166, 170, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [407, 420, "CREW"], [450, 458, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [492, 495, "ABBREVIATION"], [521, 524, "CREW"], [624, 628, "AIRPLANE"], [761, 774, "CREW"], [803, 806, "CREW"], [824, 832, "CREW"], [833, 844, "CREW"], [986, 992, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1083, 1091, "CREW"], [1218, 1226, "ALTITUDE"], [1376, 1382, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1416, 1431, "AIRPLANE"], [1645, 1651, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1803, 1811, "CREW"], [1813, 1816, "CREW"], [1932, 1935, "CREW"], [2008, 2011, "ABBREVIATION"], [2183, 2186, "ABBREVIATION"], [2211, 2219, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2422, 2425, "ABBREVIATION"], [2457, 2461, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2800, 2804, "AIRPLANE"], [2861, 2869, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2871, 2881, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2890, 2898, "ALTITUDE"], [2903, 2911, "ALTITUDE"], [2924, 2932, "CREW"], [2999, 3003, "AIRPLANE"], [3031, 3035, "AIRPLANE"], [3094, 3097, "CREW"], [3114, 3122, "ALTITUDE"], [3265, 3269, "AIRPLANE"], [3349, 3352, "ABBREVIATION"], [3438, 3445, "CREW"], [3470, 3478, "CREW"], [3490, 3503, "CREW"], [3517, 3520, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3641, 3645, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3658, 3664, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3706, 3710, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3751, 3755, "AIRPLANE"], [3771, 3786, "AIRPLANE"], [3984, 3987, "CREW"], [3991, 3994, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4097, 4100, "CREW"], [4120, 4128, "CREW"], [4162, 4179, "CREW"], [4348, 4355, "CREW"], [4356, 4362, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4406, 4409, "ABBREVIATION"], [4414, 4420, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4429, 4435, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4543, 4549, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4557, 4561, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4570, 4574, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],
	["Flight was uneventful until approaching ZZZZZ; the final approach fix for Runway XXR in ZZZ. When we placed the gear handle down; we received an ECAM for the landing gear doors not closed. The ECAM showed the gear down and locked but the gear doors in the fully extended position. I have seen the main gear doors open on the ground and know ground clearance is very close. Not knowing if they would clear on touchdown; I elected to go-around but kept the gear extended; planning to contact Maintenance for guidance. The First Officer flew the go-around and I asked her to stay below 220 kts. at 10;000 ft. MSL. I gave her the radios and asked her to tell ATC we would need delay vectors to troubleshoot the problem; while starting the ECAM procedure. I also made a PA announcement to the passengers quickly explaining the problem and telling them we were trouble shooting the problem.I referenced the QRH for L/G Doors not Closed; but the procedure is for when the doors don't retract on takeoff. The procedure directs to recycle the gear if the gear handle is up but does not address if the gear handle is down. I elected to cycle the gear up and down but the gear doors remained in the extended position. While I was doing this; I sent a message to Dispatch to 'Call Me' and received no response. After several more minutes; I sent 'Call ME NOW.' I have a screen shot of the AIRINC frequencies on my IPAD and was starting to retrieve it when I received the frequency on ACARS. I called ZZZ1 AIRINC but was not able to get immediate service because another aircraft was on the frequency. Eventually; I was patched to [another sector] and requested Maintenance Airframe. Waiting for Maintenance; I continued running the ECAM when I received another ECAM F/CTL Slat SYS 2 Fault; and then a CB tripped ECAM for CB tripped on the AFT panel followed by another ECAM for CB tripped on the overhead panel. The time delays were costing us valuable fuel which was now below 5;000 pounds. When we initiated the go-around; we had 7;700 pounds of fuel remaining but with the gear doors open and gear down our fuel was rapidly being depleted. I discovered after searching for tripped CBs they were associated with LGCIU 1 and in lieu of the rapidly depleting fuel and the time delays; I elected to reset tripped CBs; hoping they might be the cause and the solution to the problem. The overhead CB reset but the AFT one did not. I left the AFT out.During all of this I noticed ATC had moved us to the south of the airport by almost 30 miles and I asked the First Officer to have ATC keep us within 20 miles of the airport and a lot closer. Approach eventually worked us of to just southwest of the airport.By this time Maintenance came on; we were down to almost 4;300 pounds of fuel; and I explained the situation with the CBs and the gear doors. Maintenance asked if the gear showed down and locked which it did and I asked if there was a possibility of the gear doors impacting the runway on landing. The Maintenance Controller said there was a possibility [of] the gear doors sparking on landing. I am not sure how I ended the conversation with the Controller other than to say we will have to land with the doors open. At this point I called the Flight Attendants and told them to do a Cabin Prep for Evacuation. I asked them how much time they needed and they replied 10 minutes. I said unable; you have five minutes. I made a PA announcement to the passengers and explained the situation and told them it is possible the gear doors might be a problem and we would be landing soon.The First Officer had set up the FMGC for XXR and [requested priority handling from] ATC. I quickly briefed the approach and took the aircraft and asked her to tell ATC we needed to get the aircraft on the ground. I reminded her if the gear doors cause a problem and it leads to an evacuation; to grab the QRC and read the checklist. Just prior to landing; we received an ACARS message that said 'Upon furtherreview; the gear doors should not be a problem.' Great news but a little late. By now we were within the FAF for XXR. The approach was normal and at 500 feet AGL; I gave a 'BRACE BRACE BRACE' PA and the FAs started their commands. I made a very smooth touchdown and the ARFF crew said there were no sparks on landing. We rolled to a stop on the high-speed taxiway with NWS and LGCIU1 inop; and I made a PA to 'Remain Seated; Remain Seated.' Fuel was less than 3;400 pounds. We waited for a ground crew to come out and tow the airplane and they needed the gear pins that are stowed in the cockpit. We threw them out the FO's side window to the ground crew. The ground crew's interphone radio initially was very readable but became very scratchy and unreadable. It might have been because there was a different cord with the tug. We used hand signals to verify brakes released. We made the slow trip to the terminal where I briefed the mechanics; and Flight Ops representatives. A couple of lessons.The QRH needs to address Landing Gear Doors Extended on Landing. Would it have been better to retract the gear rather than leave them down? This would have reduced the fuel consumption rate and given us more time to trouble shoot the situation once Maintenance was on the line.The fuel consumption rates with the gear doors open and gear down is incredibly high. The QRH says 15% for the doors only. We were fortunate we were tankering fuel to ZZZ and had extra; but if we had been at normal landing fuel amounts; the situation would have been worse. Also; the noise level with the gear doors open is very loud.I had multiple ECAMS popping up on top of each other; with the CBs tripping. I never did see an ECAM for LGCIU1 fault but it was listed in the INOP systems. I was saturated.The lack of response from Dispatch was frustrating and wasted valuable time and fuel exacerbating our situation. When I did get through to the Maintenance Controller; I was left with very little time to be able to make any evaluative decisions and had to go with what I knew at the time.Having to go through a middle man (AIRINC) wastes time and when you get there you are on a party line.When I originally elected to go-around; I had no idea it would take us almost 35 minutes to get the aircraft back on the ground. The sense of time was very compressed. Had I known the gear doors would not be a hazard with them in the extended position; I probably would have elected to come back around immediately; evaluating the existing ECAM instead of wasting valuable time trying to contact Maintenance; but I was trying to use all our available resources. They weren't readably available.Training kicks in very fast. The Flight Attendants did a wonderful job preparing the cabin in a very short amount of time. It was the Purser's second trip since training. The First Officer; still on probation; did an outstanding job communicating to ATC; flying the aircraft; and setting us up for the follow-on approach. We were together as a crew; divided our tasks; and then came back together for the approach.I checked with Maintenance the following day and the mechanics had not been able to fix the problems.Writing this type of report has caused me to second guess and question all of my decisions. I should be satisfied the result was successful with no damage and no body injured. But I have to ask what could I; should I; have done better?", {"entities": [[28, 39, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [51, 65, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [145, 149, "AIRPLANE"], [158, 170, "AIRPLANE"], [193, 197, "AIRPLANE"], [408, 417, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [432, 441, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [490, 501, "CREW"], [520, 533, "CREW"], [534, 538, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [587, 590, "ABBREVIATION"], [595, 604, "ALTITUDE"], [606, 609, "ABBREVIATION"], [655, 658, "CREW"], [735, 739, "AIRPLANE"], [765, 767, "ABBREVIATION"], [901, 904, "ABBREVIATION"], [988, 995, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1251, 1259, "CREW"], [1472, 1477, "AIRPLANE"], [1649, 1660, "CREW"], [1683, 1694, "CREW"], [1720, 1724, "AIRPLANE"], [1749, 1753, "AIRPLANE"], [1800, 1804, "AIRPLANE"], [1857, 1861, "AIRPLANE"], [2464, 2467, "CREW"], [2544, 2557, "CREW"], [2566, 2569, "CREW"], [2627, 2635, "CREW"], [2706, 2717, "CREW"], [2835, 2846, "CREW"], [2972, 2978, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2995, 3006, "CREW"], [3007, 3017, "CREW"], [3140, 3150, "CREW"], [3185, 3189, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3420, 3422, "ABBREVIATION"], [3561, 3568, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3578, 3591, "CREW"], [3659, 3662, "CREW"], [3686, 3694, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3739, 3742, "CREW"], [3946, 3951, "AIRPLANE"], [4105, 4113, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4132, 4140, "ALTITUDE"], [4141, 4144, "ABBREVIATION"], [4175, 4177, "ABBREVIATION"], [4235, 4244, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4339, 4346, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4386, 4388, "ABBREVIATION"], [4571, 4578, "AIRPLANE"], [4602, 4604, "ABBREVIATION"], [4612, 4618, "AIRPLANE"], [4668, 4673, "AIRPLANE"], [4888, 4896, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4984, 4987, "ABBREVIATION"], [5229, 5240, "CREW"], [5347, 5350, "ABBREVIATION"], [5687, 5691, "AIRPLANE"], [5790, 5798, "CREW"], [5907, 5918, "CREW"], [5919, 5929, "CREW"], [6182, 6191, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6493, 6497, "AIRPLANE"], [6549, 6560, "CREW"], [6732, 6737, "AIRPLANE"], [6822, 6835, "CREW"], [6897, 6900, "CREW"], [6902, 6908, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6959, 6967, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7052, 7060, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7076, 7087, "CREW"]]}],
	["During our flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 our aircraft overburned the flight plan fuel calculations by 7;000 lbs at block-in.  We stayed within 1;000 feet of flight planned altitude for almost the entire flight; and never deviated significantly from the route.  The over-burn seemed to worsen over the course of the flight; however at ZZZZZ we were over 1;000 lbs above planned fuel.  At the crew change; about 7:30 into the flight we were 1;000 lbs low.  During the remaining half of the flight to top of descent we lost an additional 4;000 lbs from flight planned quantities; and during descent and landing lost another 1;000 lbs.  We blocked in with 15;600 lbs; while our REMF fuel was 21;700 lbs.  During the flight we queried the Dispatcher and asked him to have Load Planning verify all their weights.  He said he did that; and passed on their numbers; which were the numbers we had loaded from the initial weights message at the gate.  We also ran through the suspected fuel leak checklist and determined we did not have a leak.  We began discussing this with other [company] aircraft flying similar routes that evening.  Eventually; every flight to [foreign country] was in the conversation; ZZZ; ZZZ2 and ZZZ3 to ZZZ4; (I believe all 787s) and also a 777 flying ZZZ2 to ZZZ5; along with us (ZZZ-ZZZ1).  All of us had the same issue: massive overburn; insignificant deviation from planned altitudes or routes; and arriving at destination with no possibility of accepting any delays.  At least one flight did divert due to fuel shortage; I believe it was the ZZZ3-ZZZ4 crew (not sure about that.)  One other crew mentioned that they'd contacted dispatch about the situation and had essentially been informed that it was due to their being held down at lower altitudes than planned.  After learning that every single plane from the USA to [foreign country] was overburning; I again queried the dispatcher; and he called us on the satphone this time; asking what was going on.  Something was obviously not right.  One of the flights mentioned that the same thing had happened the day before and one flight had diverted that night to ZZZ5.  Dispatch then informed us that the person who had been working the night before was coming in to work in about 30 minutes and that our situation would be passed on to him as he was more familiar with what had happened the previous night.  He also mentioned that he thought a new burn profile had been uploaded to the software recently and speculated that it might have been faulty.  We didn't hear any more about it from Dispatch.I've flown the B787 on these routes; and I can't recall ever overburning a plan by more than 1;500 lbs.  7;000 lbs is beyond belief; but every flight dispatched on these routes that night was several thousand lbs under planned fuel.Dispatch asked us to file [a report] on the incident to highlight the problem and ensure it is corrected.", {"entities": [[137, 147, "ALTITUDE"], [499, 506, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [582, 589, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [929, 933, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1085, 1091, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1257, 1263, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1415, 1423, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2138, 2146, "CREW"], [2559, 2567, "CREW"], [2573, 2578, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2800, 2808, "CREW"]]}],

We feel being forced to handle radioactive material against our will and without knowledge of how dangerous it is.", {"entities": [[140, 148, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [149, 153, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],
	["Descending into ZZZ for a visual approach into Runway XX I realized we were at 4;000 ft. 5 miles from the FAF. ATC wanted us to call the airport in sight to clear us for a visual and we had the airport in sight for the past 10 miles or so. I thought when we called it in sight to each other; the PM (Pilot Monitoring) told ATC and that we were clear for a visual approach. I set 2;700 ft. in the ALT selector and the autopilot began a descent. Passing through 3;000 ft. with the airport and surroundings in sight ATC said climb to 3;000 ft. and as we just had passed it I leveled the plane out and was about to climb back up from 2;900 ft. GPWS called out terrain terrain but this was not a factor because we saw the terrain and were clear of all obstacles. I disconnected the autopilot and climbed to 3;000 ft. as instructed. Then we came in and landed with no issue.This was a miscommunication between ATC; the PM; and PF (Pilot Flying). I thought the PM told ATC we had the visual and we were cleared for the visual approach. There was a small mountain below us but this was no factor and we were clear of it according to my visual sight and chart markings. The error I believe was when I set 2;700 ft. in the ALT window without communicating it clearly with my PM. If I would've brought it to his attention and he would have understood it; I believe he would have brought up that he had not heard ATC clear us for a visual approach yet like I thought he did. I was caught up in being too high for the approach and took an action that I had not completely communicated with my crew about.\nMy FO was flying into ZZZ and was assigned 4;000 feet. When we were 10 miles away; ATC told us to report airport in sight. We saw the airport and wanted to wait till we got a little closer to call airport in sight. I than looked at my IPAD to look over the taxi and airport diagram and published miss approach. I than heard ATC say to climb to 3;000 feet and 3;000 feet was his MSA. I looked at the altitude and saw that it was set to 2;700 and we had descended to 2;900 feet. My FO began to climb and I set 3;000 feet for our altitude. Just as my FO began to climb; we got a GPWS of Terrain; Terrain. We did not go below 2;900 feet and we did not get a pull up. Also; the MSA for the Terminal Chart was 2;000 feet. We than told ATC we had the airport in sight. When the FO set a new altitude he should of announced it; so that I could of told him we were not cleared to a lower altitude. The FO should of announced his actions before descending to a lower altitude.", {"entities": [[0, 10, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [26, 41, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [79, 87, "ALTITUDE"], [111, 114, "CREW"], [323, 326, "CREW"], [356, 371, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [379, 387, "ALTITUDE"], [417, 426, "AIRPLANE"], [435, 442, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [460, 468, "ALTITUDE"], [513, 516, "CREW"], [522, 527, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [531, 539, "ALTITUDE"], [611, 616, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [630, 638, "ALTITUDE"], [777, 786, "AIRPLANE"], [791, 798, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [802, 810, "ALTITUDE"], [847, 853, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [904, 907, "CREW"], [962, 965, "CREW"], [1012, 1027, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1151, 1159, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1196, 1204, "ALTITUDE"], [1217, 1223, "AIRPLANE"], [1401, 1404, "CREW"], [1420, 1435, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1505, 1513, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1595, 1597, "ABBREVIATION"], [1602, 1608, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1635, 1645, "ALTITUDE"], [1675, 1678, "CREW"], [1893, 1901, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1916, 1919, "CREW"], [1927, 1932, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1936, 1946, "ALTITUDE"], [1951, 1961, "ALTITUDE"], [2044, 2053, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2057, 2067, "ALTITUDE"], [2072, 2074, "ABBREVIATION"], [2084, 2089, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2100, 2110, "ALTITUDE"], [2140, 2142, "ABBREVIATION"], [2152, 2157, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2214, 2224, "ALTITUDE"], [2296, 2306, "ALTITUDE"], [2321, 2324, "CREW"], [2363, 2365, "ABBREVIATION"], [2485, 2487, "ABBREVIATION"], [2527, 2537, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["Upon climb out of ZZZ to ZZZ1 both myself and the First Officer noted to each other an odor/smell that seemed pungent and potent. Neither of us could place it or even thought it was associated with a fire or smoke. Both of us assumed it was just a smelly aircraft that had been sitting outside. Later in the flight during cruise enroute to ZZZ1; I noticed a white stream of smoke coming from the dashboard. Specifically; it was erupting from behind the flight guidance control (FGC) where the mode selectors for the autopilot's climb and descend modes are located. Upon seeing the smoke; my First Officer and I realized the odd odor/smell was associated and determined that there must be some sort of electrical fire/issue/malfunction going on. I instructed my First Officer to put his oxygen mask (I did as well) and we performed our immediate action items associated with smoke in the cockpit/flight-deck. We declared [requested priority handling] with ATC. ATC gave us direct to the field and pilot's speed and descent discretion to 11;000 ft. We gave them the information for souls on board and fuel remaining. At this point; we were roughly 60 NM from ZZZ1. I directed my First Officer to notify our dispatcher/company via ACARS that we had [notified ATC] due to smoke in the cockpit and that we were landing at ZZZ1. After that; I directed my First Officer to run the associated checklists and run the appropriate data for landing. We continued to communicate with ATC and they aided us in giving us priority for a visual approach to Runway XXL at ZZZ1. The aircraft was being operated on the autopilot; however; during descent; the mode selectors on the flight guidance control panel stopped working/engaging and would not respond to any selection that I was commanding. Due to this; I switched off the autopilot and hand flew the aircraft for the rest of the flight. We landed with no issues Runway XXL and ATC asked us our intentions. The First Officer and I agreed that we did not need to evacuate as the smoke was slightly subsiding and we had no passengers on board. We still had our oxygen masks on and it seemed logical that we could taxi to the gate as long as the rescue and fire trucks follow us there as a precaution.  There was some confusion on which gate we would be parking at. Our ACARS data for arrival showed us parking at XX which is also the normal gate that we always park at in ZZZ1. However; after we arrived at XX; operations seemed to not want the aircraft there and requested that we park at XY instead. We left gate XX and taxied over to XY as demanded and powered down the aircraft and opened the door. Firefighters came on board and immediately noted the electrical fire smell and asked if we were okay. I as Captain made all the appropriate phone calls and documented the issue in the maintenance log of the aircraft. Contract maintenance personnel showed up to work on the aircraft. They were able to inform me that they removed the main panel in the cockpit and it showed signs of a fire and electrical burn up behind the flight guidance controller and that this is what caused the electrical burn and smoke in the cockpit. First; there was an odd smell in the cockpit noticed by both flight crew members. But the biggest form of detection was the visible plums of white smoke rising from behind the flight guidance control panel. The smoke was faint at first but became heavier and more visible as time went on.", {"entities": [[208, 213, "WEATHER"], [374, 379, "WEATHER"], [581, 586, "WEATHER"], [874, 879, "WEATHER"], [1268, 1273, "WEATHER"], [2015, 2020, "WEATHER"], [3141, 3146, "WEATHER"], [3310, 3315, "WEATHER"], [3374, 3379, "WEATHER"], [5, 10, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [50, 63, "CREW"], [322, 328, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [516, 525, "AIRPLANE"], [528, 533, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [591, 604, "CREW"], [761, 774, "CREW"], [887, 894, "AIRPLANE"], [955, 958, "CREW"], [960, 963, "CREW"], [996, 1001, "CREW"], [1014, 1021, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1036, 1045, "ALTITUDE"], [1149, 1151, "ABBREVIATION"], [1177, 1190, "CREW"], [1228, 1233, "AIRPLANE"], [1256, 1259, "CREW"], [1281, 1288, "AIRPLANE"], [1306, 1313, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1349, 1362, "CREW"], [1471, 1474, "CREW"], [1521, 1536, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1599, 1608, "AIRPLANE"], [1626, 1633, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1810, 1819, "AIRPLANE"], [1829, 1833, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1878, 1884, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1915, 1918, "CREW"], [1948, 1961, "CREW"], [2148, 2152, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2160, 2164, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2271, 2275, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2304, 2309, "AIRPLANE"], [2376, 2380, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2396, 2400, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2431, 2438, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2517, 2521, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2545, 2549, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2557, 2563, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2632, 2636, "AIRPLANE"], [2745, 2752, "CREW"], [2822, 2833, "CREW"], [2864, 2875, "CREW"], [2989, 2996, "AIRPLANE"], [3154, 3161, "AIRPLANE"], [3200, 3207, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["After landing at ZZZ and bringing the engines to idle I noticed a whishing sound coming from the main rotor system.  There weren't any associated vibrations.  The medical crew did their walk around and after getting in; the flight nurse also stated that she heard the same noise.  I brought the engines to flight and the noise was still present but not as noticeable.  Looking at the disc path plane revealed nothing.  I raised the collective enough to get the nose to raise and almost immediately plastic sheeting was seen leaving the main rotor system.  I shut the helicopter down.  Upon walk around plastic sheeting was observed on two of the main rotors; three of the fenestron blades; on the stator vanes of the fenestron and on the protective covering over the oil cooler intake.  The helicopter was placed out of service and maintenance was notified.  The mechanic inspected the aircraft and an operational check flight was completed.  No damage was found.  I never saw where the plastic entered the rotor system.  There was a construction dumpster underneath the helipad that was only partially covered.  There appeared to be a similar type of plastic in it.

	["We flew to SUS; the weather in SUS was 1600 OVC per the ATIS; but when we got closer during the descent we saw the airport. It was clear surrounding the airport. The Pilot Monitoring mentioned that the airport was visible beyond 'those very bright lights.' I looked up and saw the airport; and indeed an area of extremely bright; white lights. Because the lights were so close to the airport; we were taken by surprise; and wondered about what that could be; and why any facility would need that many bright lights. We reported the airport in sight; and received a visual clearance from ATC. When switched to the Tower; we received a landing clearance. I engaged the APP mode; to lessen my workload; and we intercepted the final course and glideslope. When we were aligned with the runway; the full extent of those bright lights hit us. It was horrible! Completely unsafe. These lights were bright outside proportion and extremely distracting. We both commented on the brightness again; and then I briefed the Pilot Monitoring that I was going to keep my head down and inside; focused on the instruments; so that I would not have to look outside into the lights. They were interfering with my night vision and disrupting our final approach. The Pilot Monitoring kept looking outside; and he commented that the lights were so bright that they unwittingly made him look at them even though he did not want to. After we passed the area; I was finally able to look back outside at the runway. The landing was fine and uneventful. When we were taxiing I told the Pilot Monitoring that I was taking the radio for a minute. I then asked the SUS Tower if he had time for a question. I asked what the area of bright lights were; and the Tower informed us that those were the lights at a golf facility. He asked if they were distracting and we said yes; extremely so. The Tower also informed us that apparently there were multiple reports filed on this. So obviously we were not the only ones bothered by those lights.Something has to be done about this. It is surprising to me that such a facility was allowed to be build right in the final flight path. The lights are extremely distracting. They interfere with the night vision; they interfere with the safety of flight itself. Because in our case we were discussing the lights and their location and we briefed how we were going to proceed; at a phase of flight where we are not even supposed to be speaking unless it's SOP. The flight conditions were VMC; but I wonder on a night where there is fog; or a very low ceiling; how the light will break through the moisture and reflect in the cockpit. In our opinion these lights are dangerous and could potentially lead to worse distraction.", {"entities": [[20, 27, "WEATHER"], [2539, 2542, "WEATHER"], [2558, 2565, "WEATHER"], [2604, 2612, "WEATHER"], [3, 7, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [56, 60, "ABBREVIATION"], [96, 103, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [587, 590, "CREW"], [613, 618, "CREW"], [667, 670, "ABBREVIATION"], [782, 788, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1225, 1239, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1481, 1487, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1539, 1546, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1597, 1602, "AIRPLANE"], [1638, 1643, "CREW"], [1728, 1733, "CREW"], [1862, 1867, "CREW"], [2632, 2639, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["During our arrival into Houston; we heard a flap speed aural warning. Our flaps were set to 2 and our speed was approximately 220 kts for about 5 seconds. First Officer immediately disconnected the autopilot and pitched up; while I returned the flaps to 1. On the arrival; we were assigned a speed of 210 kts and told to maintain 8;000 feet. Subsequently; we were given 7;000 feet and THEN reduce to 190 kts as we approached the Runway 8R localizer. At 8;000 feet; the First Officer reduced our speed to 190 kts and called for flaps 2. After the intercept; at about 20 nm we were cleared for the Runway 8R approach. We were following a larger aircraft and hit a little wake turbulence; I was a little distracted by it. The First Officer changed the altitude to 2;000 feet and the speed accelerated past 215 kts. At the gate; we wrote up the flap overspeed in the AML with Maintenance. We debriefed the event and agreed that; in that situation; 'green' FLCH would have prevented the overspeed. For me; personally; I should have been well aware that we were above the glidepath and would accelerate in PATH. I should not have selected flaps 2 before the descent.For my First Officer; we reviewed the protections that green FLCH offers us in the descent.

	["I was the assigned First Officer for Flight XXXX from ZZZ to ZZZ1. The other crew assigned to the flight were [the] Captain and Flight Attendants. The Captain was a 'green' Captain with less than 100 hours in this aircraft type as PIC. I was the Pilot Flying and the Captain was the Pilot Monitoring.The aircraft assigned for this flight had 3 MEL items.Emer Equip CompartmentsPack Flow Cntrl VlvsAir Conditioning PacksThe crew and I arrived at the gate a few minutes prior to our show time. After getting the release from Ops I performed the external walk-around and did not find any irregularities. Upon returning to the cockpit I conducted my internal safety checks and Post Power Up Configuration flow. I then obtained both the current ATIS as well as our clearance and filled out the takeoff/landing distance card.Approximately 15 minutes prior to our scheduled departure I gave the takeoff brief after the Captain had finished programming the MCDU. During this brief the Captain and I discussed the items on the MEL list. Bleed Air #1 was already placarded as 'Inop'; the Captain set ECS to 'Off' for takeoff per the release and MEL notes; and we agreed we would leave the APU 'On' until after takeoff as this was a recommendation in the MEL notes with the Bleed 1 'inop'. After this briefing we completed the Before Start checklist.We pushed back from the gate. After ground equipment had been removed we conducted the Flight Control check and After Start checklist. During the taxi to the runway the Captain instructed me to start Engine 2. After confirming a good start and starting my timer; I inadvertently shut down the APU as a matter of habit; forgetting that we had briefed to leave it on. I then conducted the Taxi checklist and shortly afterward the Before Takeoff checklist when we were directed by Tower to taxi into position and hold on the runway. After getting into position on Runway XXL the Captain passed the flight controls to me.The takeoff was normal. At approximately 2;000 feet the Captain noted that the APU had been turned off. He attempted to start it but the start failed and an EICAS message 'APU Fail' was presented. As the Flying Pilot I then directed the Captain to 'run the QRH for APU fail'. However; the message went away because the Captain had turned the APU switch to 'OFF' and subsequently said the QRH procedure wasn't necessary because the EICAS message had cleared. I did not question this.At approximately FL300 the EICAS presented a yellow caution 'BLEED 2 OVERPRESS' message with a single chime. I called 'cancel and identify' and the Captain called out the message as presented. I then directed him to run the QRH for this item. At this point the aircraft was leveling off at our assigned altitude of FL310. The Captain was approximately a third of the way into the 'BLEED 2 OVERPRESS' QRH procedure when the EICAS presented a red 'CABIN HIGH ALT' warning with a triple chime. After canceling and identifying the warning we immediately donned our O2 masks and attempted to establish crew communication. I could not hear myself speaking and believed I had a problem with the microphone in my mask; but I could hear the Captain. He also said he could hear me. I then instructed the Captain to perform the EPC for 'CABIN HIGH ALT' as I began a controlled descent. The Captain then called ATC to declare our emergency and request a lower altitude.ATC replied to the Captain they could not understand what he said and asked him to repeat his request; which he did. ATC replied they still could not understand his request. At this point another aircraft told ATC of our issue and request. ATC then cleared us to descend to FL240 and I set this in the altimeter; selected green FLCH; selected manual speed set at 250; then put out our speed brakes at full. I did not turn off the auto-throttles. The aircraft was descending at approximately 3;500 to 4;000 ft./min.I was having a great deal of trouble seeing outof the O2 mask. The plastic face plate itself was clouded and difficult to see clearly out of; especially when sunlight was hitting it directly. This was not due to my breathing. The plastic of the face plate itself was clouded and unclear. I had to hold my right hand up to block the sun to prevent excessive glare and further reduce my ability to see clearly. The problems I was having with the O2 mask were excessively distracting to me during the course of our [expedited] descent to 10;000 ft. I had to lean in close to the PFD/MFD in order to see them clearly.Very quickly approaching FL240 the Captain again called ATC asking for 10;000 ft. ATC replied they were unable due to conflicting traffic. The Captain again [requested priority handling] and ATC cleared us to descend to 10;000 ft. on a vectored heading. I set the altimeter to 10;000 ft.; selected green heading; then set the heading bug to the assigned heading.ATC then asked us how many souls were on board; what our fuel state was; and what our intentions were. The Captain gave them this information and requested to be cleared direct back to ZZZ; stating that he understood the weather to be better there than at ZZZ1. ATC then cleared us direct to ZZZ and I began reprogramming the FMS to return to ZZZ. I had trouble doing this both because I could not see clearly and did not get the FMS programmed quickly. I recall at one point ATC asked us why we had not turned direct to ZZZ. I told the Captain I was having trouble and he helped me set ZZZ as our destination. I then set direct ZZZ; selected LNAV; and we turned direct for ZZZ off of the vector we had been given.As I was doing that the Captain was using ACARS to communicate with the company. Shortly thereafter he told me that the company wanted us to divert to ZZZ1 rather than ZZZ and that we were going to divert to ZZZ1 instead of ZZZ. He had obtained the current weather there from ATC; noting that arrivals were landing west on XXL and XXR. The Captain then got an ATC clearance to fly direct to ZZZ1 and I changed our destination to ZZZ1in the FMS. Upon reaching 10;000 ft. we took our O2 masks off. I put on my headset but just after doing so I immediately heard a horrible feedback in the form of a high pitch feedback whine such as what happens when an open microphone is too close to a speaker. Like trying to see through the O2 mask; this was highly distracting and nerve-wracking to me. I had to hold the microphone of my headset in my closed left fist in order to prevent the feedback. The Captain then reminded me to close the doors to the O2 mask compartment and then press the test button there to disable the O2 microphone; which I did. This resolved the feedback issue.The Captain then made a cabin PA and I asked him if all emergency QRH checklists had been completed. He told me yes they were completed. He then got the landing speeds for the ILS XXR from ACARS while I reviewed the ILS XXR approach and set the localizer frequency in the standby Nav 1 & 2 with autotune enabled. I then briefed the approach for the ILS XXR and called for the approach checklist which we completed. ATC gave us a vector to the downwind for the ILS XXR and descended us to 5;000 ft. A short time later we were turned onto the downwind and cleared to 3;000 ft. We were turned onto base after passing the fix ZZZZZ on the ILS XXR approach; then turned to intercept the localizer and cleared for the ILS XXR approach. From this point onward we flew the standard company precision approach profile (ILS) and landed without further incident.The taxi-in was normal. We exited XXR at [Taxiway] XX and were told to contact ground. After contacting ground we completed the taxi-in checklist and were progressively taxied around the west side of the field to gate XXXX. Once there and parked we ran the shutdown checklist. The passengers were deplaned into the gate area. We were given a replacement aircraft approximately an hour and a half later; re-boarded our passengers; and flew to ZZZ without further incident. One of our flight attendants elected not to continue. It is also my understanding that the O2 mask for seat 4A did not deploy and there was a passenger in that seat.In looking through the QRH after this event and reviewing this event with the Captain; I determined we did not complete the QRH procedures properly. In the case of the red 'HIGH CABIN ALT' warning the pressurization 'DUMP' button was not pressed upon reaching 10;000 ft. as called for at the end of that QRH procedure. Also; in the case of the yellow 'BLEED 2 OVERPRESS' caution message; if the steps listed in the first part of the procedure fail to clear the EICAS message; the end of that procedure calls for 1) idling the affected engine's thrust lever and 2) performing a 'ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE APPROACH AND LANDING'; which is not what we did. During this event I believed we had completed these checklists.1. I suggest moving the 'APU.....AS RQRD' item from the 'After Start' checklist to the 'Before Takeoff' checklist. It is standard line practice to taxi out to the runway on engine #1 (E1) before starting engine #2 (E2) when the Captain judges we are just a few minutes away from taking off. Moreover; 9 out of every 10 captains I have flown with leave the APU on to start E2 rather than perform a cross-bleed start. Because of the combination of these two factors; having the 'APU....AS REQUIRED' on the 'After Start' checklist rather than the 'Before Takeoff' checklist appears to defeat the purpose of having this on the checklist in this particular case. If this item was on the 'Before Takeoff' checklist I believe this would have caught my error in turning the APU off after starting E2 on the taxi out to the runway.2. I cannot overstate how distracting it was for me to be unable to see clearly out of the O2 mask. From the moment I put it on it was a distraction that bled time and attention away from effectively dealing with the [situation]. With everything that had happened and was happening at the time; I did not think to inspect it after arriving at the gate in ZZZ; so I cannot say with certainty if the face plate was simply dirty or the plastic itself was the cause. What I know for certain is I never had an issue with them in the sims before; but those are used on an almost daily basis and are cleaned regularly. Also; the sim is usually dark and so real sunlight (i.e. glare) is never experienced while using the O2 mask in training.

	["We were at FL 350 Preparing to descend via the [arrival] into ZZZ. As we reached top of descent we heard a bang and felt the airplane shudder. I asked the deadheading Captain to go see if he could see anything abnormal on the main deck; which he said it was normal. We looked at the load paperwork and determined that it was unlikely a load shift. We spent the rest of the descent talking about what it could have been and working out a plan to manage the plane throughout the approach and landing. I decided we would slow and configure the airplane early to be able to recover if any abnormalities occurred during a configure change. Approach asked us if we wanted the visual or ILS to Runway XXL in ZZZ to which I chose the ILS. At this point; we were at 4;000 ft. and were cleared to cross SPLAT at 2;400 ft. On descent from 4;000 ft. to 2;400 ft.; we experienced a series of several bangs and the associated airframe shudders. I [requested priority handling] with approach and turned the autopilot off so I could know sooner if there was any control degradation. At that point; my First Officer resumed the radio and answered ATC's standard inquiries after [requesting priority handling].After several bangs had occurred; the Captain in the observers seat pointed out abnormal indications of the right engine. It was that point where I figured what we were likely experiencing was compressor stalls on the right engine. I determined the safest action to take since the engine was malfunctioning was to shut it down and secure it and called for the engine severe damage immediate action items. With the additional benefit of having an extra set of eyes in the observers seat verifying the proper actions were being taken; the engine was secured and the bangs and airframe shudders stopped.After we had the engine secured we determined we were far enough out and already configured at flaps 20 for a single engine landing and I decided to go ahead and land rather than continue flying on one engine.I had requested that the airport 'roll the equipment' since we weren't sure something else wasn't going on and to be able to respond immediately if the need would have been necessary. After landing; we rolled down to the end of Runway XXL and taxied into the de-ice pad so the emergency personnel could assess the condition of the exterior of the plane. They reported we had a panel open; but everything else looked normal. After they finished their assessment; I determined we could taxi to our gate without any further assistance and released them with my appreciation for a job well done. After the trucks cleared; I called for the after landing flow and we taxied to our gate on the remaining engine.Once at the gate; one of the mechanics came up and asked about the RAT (Ram Air Turbine) being deployed. That's when what the emergency responder's statement about a panel being opened made sense. I looked at the switch on the overhead panel and it was in the normal position and safety wired shut so I'm confident its deployment was the result of some other malfunction that triggered it since the normal deployment parameters weren't metThe proficiency and professionalism of my First Officer and the deadheading Captain (which became a valuable member of my crew) were absolutely exemplary. They made an abnormal situation requiring an engine shutdown very manageable. They; along with the support from ATC and airport rescue significantly contributed to the safe outcome of the flight that morning.", {"entities": [[11, 13, "ABBREVIATION"], [31, 38, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [88, 95, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [167, 174, "CREW"], [373, 380, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [477, 485, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [635, 643, "CREW"], [680, 683, "ABBREVIATION"], [726, 729, "ABBREVIATION"], [757, 765, "ALTITUDE"], [802, 810, "ALTITUDE"], [815, 822, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [828, 836, "ALTITUDE"], [841, 849, "ALTITUDE"], [912, 920, "AIRPLANE"], [968, 976, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [992, 1001, "AIRPLANE"], [1085, 1098, "CREW"], [1111, 1116, "AIRPLANE"], [1130, 1133, "CREW"], [1230, 1237, "CREW"], [1255, 1259, "AIRPLANE"], [1306, 1312, "AIRPLANE"], [1416, 1422, "AIRPLANE"], [1473, 1479, "AIRPLANE"], [1552, 1558, "AIRPLANE"], [1673, 1677, "AIRPLANE"], [1729, 1735, "AIRPLANE"], [1766, 1774, "AIRPLANE"], [1809, 1815, "AIRPLANE"], [1909, 1915, "AIRPLANE"], [1954, 1958, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1980, 1986, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1994, 2000, "AIRPLANE"], [2244, 2250, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2485, 2489, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2497, 2501, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2662, 2668, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2676, 2680, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2698, 2704, "AIRPLANE"], [2717, 2721, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3186, 3199, "CREW"], [3220, 3227, "CREW"], [3344, 3350, "AIRPLANE"], [3411, 3414, "CREW"]]}],
	["Conducting a visual backed up by the RNAV on Runway 36 at BHM. Conditions were clear in daylight. Received a 'caution obstacle' aural and a 'GND PROX' caution. The entire approach was stable; following an appropriate glide path to the runway. Advisory VNAV to the runway was used to assist in guidance but not as a primary aid. The pilot flying was above the snowflake. No depictions on airport charts indicated that EGPWS warnings occur on this approach to the runway or any other runway at the airport. The warning stopped and the approach was safely continued.Cause: Lack of terrain depictions on charts or vertical guidance for that runwaySuggestions: Addition of terrain warnings on charts. I would not suggest the use of this runway for visual approaches.\nWe were on a visual approach to Runway 36 at BHM. The conditions were clear and the visibility was unrestricted. I was using the RNAV (GPS) Runway 36 to back up the visual approach. I joined the final in between IMOBY and BERFY. We were established on the final approach segment before BERFY. While on the approach; I started a descent and used the advisory VNAV as guidance to the runway. During the entire approach; all of the terrain and obstacles were in sight and I believed that I planned the descent accordingly. Just passed BERFY we received a Caution Obstacle aural message. I shallowed the descent and the aural message stopped. We continued on the approach stabilized throughout and without any further message.Cause: Perhaps one contributing factor is that while we were stabilized on the approach; a shallower descent rate is required at that point on the approach so as to not trip off the aural message. Another contributing factor I think is that although I reviewed all of the charts associated with this airport and I think there could be a greater emphasis on the terrain in the area. Suggestions: In the future; for this particular airport; I plan to use a different runway to prevent this from occurring. Even though I felt like I had a good understanding of the terrain in the area; I want to continue to develop a greater awareness of the airport environment and the ability to better identify these potential hazards.", {"entities": [[846, 856, "WEATHER"], [37, 41, "ABBREVIATION"], [141, 144, "ABBREVIATION"], [171, 179, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [235, 241, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [252, 256, "ABBREVIATION"], [264, 270, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [332, 337, "CREW"], [446, 454, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [462, 468, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [482, 488, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [533, 541, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [732, 738, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [743, 760, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [775, 790, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [891, 895, "ABBREVIATION"], [897, 900, "AIRPLANE"], [927, 942, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1018, 1032, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1068, 1076, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1090, 1097, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1120, 1124, "ABBREVIATION"], [1144, 1150, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1170, 1178, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1261, 1268, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1362, 1369, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1421, 1429, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1563, 1571, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1585, 1592, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1631, 1639, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1949, 1955, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

	["We were conducting a day turn. Flight inbound to ZZZZ was normal. I was the pilot flying on the outbound leg. We set up and briefed for a Config 1 FLEX takeoff from Runaway XX in ZZZZ. During takeoff roll; I selected thrust levers to FLEX and upon confirming FMA realized my thrust display was blank. I advised my First Officer and told him that I was selecting TOGA. I selected thrust levers to TOGA and confirmed my FMA and noted the thrust field was still blank and I also noted that the A/THR arm display (white) was missing. My FMA did display SRS; Nav & 1FD2. Since I was uncertain if any other systems may have dropped off and there was more than enough runway remaining to stop the aircraft safely; I elected to discontinue the takeoff. I called reject at approximately 90 kts which was well below the V1 of 141 kts. I selected thrust levers to full reverse and immediately felt and heard the left main landing gear tire/tires skid. I also sensed the aircraft pulling to the left at the same time. The right landing gear and right ABS functioned normally. I used the brake pedals to disconnect auto-brake; return the aircraft to center line and manually bring the aircraft to a stop. We returned back to the ramp.Prior to parking and shut down; my First Officer and I quickly reviewed the aircraft and system status and checked for any ECAMs. We also reviewed the MCDU setup to see if we may have overlooked something. We found no discrepancies. All systems showed normal with no messages or lights. The OAT was approximately 34C and the ECAM Wheel page showed MAX brake temperatures on the left side was well above 300C (~650C at No. 2 wheel) barring a second takeoff attempt. Furthermore; I was reluctant to proceed any further without a deeper system check. We parked and shutdown both engines. We asked for fire trucks as a precaution as our ground personnel reported some fumes/smoke emanating from the left truck and we also requested fans to cool the brakes. We briefed our FA's and made a PA announcement to our passengers then contacted ZZZZZ OPS and maintenance. I then contacted our [fleet manager] and advised him of the details of our high speed reject and requested any support he might be able to provide. After discussing the malfunction; it was suspected that the source of the problem may have been the A/THR (Autothrust) system. We advised maintenance that if it was necessary; we were okay with continuing the flight with a deferred A/THR system.ZZZZ Tech Ops with support from [additional maintenance team]; performed maintenance for the next 4+ hours necessitating exercising the tarmac delay program for our passengers. When the aircraft was finally cleared for flight; I asked maintenance if they had any insight for the malfunction but they couldn't provide any clear answers; except that the system diagnostic showed all systems passed. The only issue they uncovered was that the FAC1 had dropped offline. I discussed my concerns with our [flight manager] who had been following our progress. I told him that I was uncomfortable with attempting another takeoff at night in mountainous region without first performing a functional check of the A/THR system which was suspect. He agreed that this was the best way to assure that the issue has been resolved. After some discussion; we were finally approved by Maintenance for a test run on the runway with no passengers. We setup the aircraft for departure on the runway and conducted a successful functional check. Unfortunately; by this time we were out of FDP time. It had been a very long day and my crew and I were exhausted therefore we elected not to extend our duty period requiring an unscheduled overnight stay in ZZZZ.This was definitely a challenging event for my entire crew. I am extremely proud of the way they handled this incident. They were kind; compassionate and professional in taking great care of our passengers.

We made it to step 12 where the left pack was selected ON and the right pack selected OFF then wait one minute. After roughly 10 seconds the left pack failed with an INOP light illuminated. With no packs operating the cabin altitude began to rapidly climb so we selected the right pack to ON. The PACK OFF light remained illuminated so we initiated a descent initially to 25;000 ft. During the descent the Cabin Altitude alarm went off so the First Officer and I donned our oxygen masks and performed the 'CABIN ALTITUDE' procedure. The right pack did appear to come back online but even with the rapid descent it was unable to reverse the loss of cabin pressure. We requested descent to 10;000 ft. Even passing 20;000 ft. the cabin altitude showed a climb so we determined the aircraft was not capable of maintaining pressurization. We [advised ATC] and requested immediate diversion to ZZZ. Upon leveling off at 10;000 ft. the cabin altitude stabilized and we continued to an uneventful approach and landing at ZZZ.The inability of the air conditioning system to maintain cabin temperature followed by pack failure led to loss of cabin pressurization.I believe this was a critical system component failure which tends to be rare at this company.

	["ZZZ to ZZZ1. Leg five of five on day one of a four day trip. I was Pilot Flying and the Captain was Pilot Monitoring. Departing ZZZ during reported windshear. Take off was accomplished bleeds off as per FSM. At acceleration height the Captain accomplished his flow and we continued on course normally. While at cruise altitude of 17;000 ft. we received a Master Caution Cabin Press warning. I announced it and then looked up at the bleed panel to see the bleeds were still selected off. Knowing that is not the correct position I selected them on and was going to call for the checklist when the caution extinguished. The Immediate Action Card for this caution describes donning oxygen masks and deciding if we need an emergency descent. Finally it refers us to another checklist in the Emergency and Abnormal checklist. As neither of these were necessary to solve the problem; we decided to forgo the checklist because the problem was solved. With the caution extinguished we continued with the flight as normal while monitoring the cabin pressure indications. The cabin maintained pressure and landed without further incident.I see this as an oversight of procedure that could have been solved by better monitoring; checklist and flow usage. At acceleration height on windshear takeoffs; the bleeds shall be selected on per FSM. While reading the after-takeoff checklist; the bleeds are also to be referenced and verified on. During the 10;000 ft. flow; pressurization should be checked and ensure it is in normal limits. And finally while setting cruise power the pressurization shall be monitored. All of these were missed so I believe they are probably systematically missed during flows since most takeoffs are accomplished bleeds on. Another cause could have been fatigue. We were on Flight Duty Period Watch and both the Captain and I took an extension. During debrief with the captain after the incident we both see the long day could have had an effect. As a lesson to be learned from; I see that as Pilot Flying I shall keep an eye on the flows and make sure at cruise we are pressurizing. Another lesson is to not take extensions. While I was not fatigued; there is no reason to continue past federal limits which could lead to a fatigue event.", {"entities": [[148, 157, "WEATHER"], [1040, 1048, "WEATHER"], [1083, 1091, "WEATHER"], [1270, 1279, "WEATHER"], [2039, 2042, "WEATHER"], [88, 95, "CREW"], [118, 127, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [159, 167, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [235, 242, "CREW"], [311, 317, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [330, 339, "ALTITUDE"], [729, 736, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1034, 1039, "AIRPLANE"], [1066, 1071, "AIRPLANE"], [1096, 1102, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1280, 1288, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1355, 1362, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1439, 1448, "ALTITUDE"], [1550, 1556, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1704, 1712, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1829, 1836, "CREW"], [1886, 1893, "CREW"], [2073, 2079, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["Flight Attendant 3 brought to my attention that there was an unusual odor in the back of the main cabin. I went to the back and confirmed; Flight Attendant 3 and 4 were unaware of odor but looked unexpressive. I notified the Captain. He said planes have funny smells; I said yes but this smells different; something smells like it is a hot electrical smell. Captain said check ovens; there are no ovens in the back galley. We then were troubleshooting where it was coming from; a foul; electric; burned plastic smell. Passengers; cell phones; batteries; bathrooms; galley. I looked up; turned on the air vents in the galley as I stepped back I looked up at the vents above the Flight Attendant jumpseats; that is where the odor was coming from. It was 1 hour into the flight; the Captain said there was nowhere to land we have to go to [destination] at this point. I suggested that the #2; #4 flight attendants go up to the front of the cabin to get some air in the front galley. When we landed the Captain asked us what we wanted to do; he wanted to go home. I suggested that the Captain should go back and smell it; have a mechanic check out the odor as well. It was not normal; my gut feeling was this is not safe. Then the gate agent came up and others smelled it while the door was open and the air was flowing through the cabin. That is when the Captain; First Officer and then the Mechanic went back to check it out. They smelled it with the door open; now smell it with the back door closed? It was worse. The Mechanic went down to check it out; he came up to tell us; he showed us on his phone a picture; that it had failed the test; he called [Maintenance Control]; they grounded the plane. It wasn't safe to go back to ZZZ. Captain and First Officer got a room; we were told a ferry plane was coming in; they timed out and needed rest and would be taking the plane back in the morning. There were no rooms for us. Scheduling wanted us to work back the ferry flight; we declined since it was a fume event; we would deadhead back and seek medical attention since now we could not get off the plane [due to] security. So the rolling delay began; 2 hours; 4 hours; 6 hours 7 hours; sunset later; if it wasn't for the mechanic who went to a burrito; then later he went to get us a slice of pizza he ordered and paid for; that is all we had to eat. We felt light-headed; tired; stressed; hot and dehydrated. We followed procedures in communicating with the Captain and company. Were we safe staying on this plane with this smell? We stayed in the forward part of the plane with only the front door open. I asked 5 things; deadhead back to base; Flight Service meet the flight; a car to take us to the hospital; a room to sleep then be able to go home. Being #1; a trained Flight Attendant and a CIRT (Critical Incident Response Team) member. That is what we are trained to do. Be safe and safety first!I think that the Captain could have been more proactive; caring for his flight crew safety; writing this event up in the book. A hotel? Food? Supported us. The First Officer was helpful; he spoke the language. We ALL wanted to go to ZZZ; he home and we had a great layover and finish our trip; get paid. To prevent this event from reoccurring? Maintain the air filters on our airplanes; do more safety checks; when flight attendants bring up odd odors in the cabin they should listen not dismiss it; write it off!

	["I was working as the #4 [Flight Attendant]; leaving ZZZ. During the taxi; the #2 and I smelled an odor that resembled tar and eggs. Minutes later the Captain called and asked if we smelled anything. We said yes and described the odor. The #1 and #3 up in the front also smelled it. The Captain circled around to see if it would dissipate; but it did not. We went back to the gate. All of the flight attendants had headaches. I also felt a slight pain in my chest and short shallow breathing. After discussion with the Captain and crew; we deplaned the passengers and went with the paramedics to test our vital signs. I gave the #1 one of the fume event yellow plastic cards to keep for reference and explained that fume events are serious. She has only been flying 2 years. After we were checked; the paramedics said we were ok. While waiting; I turned my phone on to text my Supervisor and to call Operations. My Supervisor said the #1 needed to call Operations. I let her use my phone to call Operations. We waited for the mechanics to determine what caused the odor. We were told that bovine serum had spilled and mixed with dry ice in cargo and that was the issue. By time they remedied the situation; the crew felt well enough to fly back to ZZZ1.While taxiing out; we stopped and sat. The Captain said that weights and balances needed to be done by hand and that it is normally done by computer and that it would take some time. We sat on the tarmac for about 20 minutes. During that time the #2 and I smelled exhaust fumes. We sat there breathing the fumes. While this does frequently happen when sitting in the back; it doesn't reduce the health risks; symptoms or discomfort. My nose was burning and I was; again; getting a headache. The #2 and I did not call the Captain as we wanted to get home after the morning we had; and the total trip. We took off finally. When we were up in the air; I called the Captain and told him about the exhaust fumes. He said we would discuss [it] once on the ground. When we got to ZZZ1; the Captain wanted to have a debrief. He told me that I was wrong not to call him about the exhaust fumes. I said he was right and I apologized. The #3 then said; that happens all the time and is normal. I cut him off saying; it might be common but it is not something we should be breathing and has health effects. The #1 rolled her eyes and said I complained about everything. She abruptly stood up and said she was leaving and didn't need this. The Captain handled this professionally and responsibly. I was confident that he was taking care of the crew.The managers and Captain finished the meeting and everyone left. I was the only one who went to be tested. The others knew they had this option but elected to go home. I was looked at by a nurse practitioner. She looked in my nose and throat; took my vitals and offered me saline nose spray and a Tylenol. I showed her the yellow card and said I needed to have blood taken for carbon monoxide. She said she had to ask the doctor. Another person came in and he said I had to get a claim report. I said I didn't know anything about how to do this. He gave me the paper to call [Administration]; which I did.

	["I was working as the #4 on Aircraft X; leaving ZZZZ to ZZZ.  We boarded once; had a fume event; deplaned and boarded again. I conducted my exit row briefing as all passengers were already seated in the exit rows. I went to the front to tell the #1; exit rows briefed.  While standing near the boarding door; a woman boarded and said to us; 'the three guys behind me are drunk.'   Behind her were three tall men; one was very big; who were loud and rambunctious.  I said the #1 and #3 that they should not be allowed to board. They dismissed my comment and said they would talk to them.  I entered the cockpit and calmly said to the Captain; 'three drunk passengers just boarded and it is policy per our manual to not allow drunk passengers to board; but I will respect your decision whatever you decide to do.'  At this point the passenger who sat in XXC (my tablet showed that as an empty seat) was loudly going through all the overhead bins looking for a missing bag.  He finally found it. Prior to that he had trouble finding his seat and had to go back up to row 14 from about row 25.  I did smell alcohol on XXC passenger. (I have; unfortunately; a very good sense of smell.) The #3 apparently spoke to him (I did not see that) and the #3 and #1 said the passengers in XXA; XXB and XXC were fine to fly. The agent and CRO (Complaint Resolution Officer) came on and told the Captain they were OK to fly.  Based on the information from the #1; #3; agent and CRO the Captain made the decision to let them remain on board. While taxiing out; we stopped and sat for about 20 minutes or longer; due to weights and balances that needed to be done by hand (as explained by the Captain via a PA). When we started to go again we were close to take off and there was yelling and screaming; and the call light being pushed at around row 14.  The #1 started walking back.  I was concerned the #1 would be in the aisle during take-off so I made an announcement that if it was an emergency to ring the call light again; otherwise the flight attendants had to remain seated as we are about to take off.  I then called the Captain.  He said he heard my announcement and stopped. The #2 went up to the passenger and spoke with him.  The #1 went back up to the front.  The #2 said that XXC said we 'were delaying the flight to make more money and that he pays our f_____ salary.'  (You will have to check with the #2 about details of that conversation.)  The #2 came to the back; called the captain and said we could go. When ready to start the service; the #2 said he is not comfortable serving any alcohol on this flight with these rowdy passengers.  I said ok; you are the galley; I am fine with that.  When pushing the cart up I told the #3 that the #2 did not want to serve alcohol.  At about row 3 the #3 asked me to go to the back to get a vodka.  I said the #2 isn't comfortable serving alcohol.  He made a comment I didn't hear.  I then said if you want one vodka; then get it from first.  He went to first and got it.  He then proceeded to get several other drinks for a few rows from first.  This put me in an awkward middle situation between the #2 and #3. When we got to row XX; I worked the cart so the #3 could deal with XXA; B; C.  Of course they requested alcoholic drinks. I did not hear what the #3 said; but he did not give him alcohol that I could see. Then my passengers were asking for drinks also.  If the #3 had complied with the request of the #2 not to serve; I wouldn't have; but because the #3 was serving; I did.  I went to the #2 and requested wine; vodka.  He said we aren't doing drinks.  I said but the #3 started serving so we kind of have to.  He said what about the last three rows that I told we aren't serving.  I said; I don't know. Just before landing I called the Captain and said I wanted to update him on what has occurred so he wouldn't be blindsided with anything later on.  He said we would discuss once on the ground. When we got to ZZZ; the Captain wanted to have a debrief. During the debrief (there was also a fume event on this flight); the Captain said he allowed the passenger to board because the #1; #3; agent and CRO said the passenger was good to fly.  When he finished I said; 'Captain; the #2 and I have 22 years of flying each.  The #1 and #3 are new hires.  In this case; experience trumps opinion and while their opinion was that these passengers could fly; experience tells us that if there is a problem on the ground; it is much worse in the air. The #1 and #3 then got mad and said some remarks (frankly at this point I stopped listening to them.  I had had it.)  I added; 'it is in our manual as part of flight attendant procedures not to board drunk passengers.' He said that he made the decision based on what the #1; #3; agent and CRO said.  I said I understood that and then added; 'the agents just want to get rid of the passengers and have a history of boarding them when they shouldn't so they don't have to deal with them.' The #1 rolled her eyes and said I complained about everything. She abruptly stood up and said she was leaving and didn't need to hear anymore of this. The managers and Captain finished the meeting and everyone left.  Suggestions: For new hires to follow procedure and not allow drunk passengers to board.  Also for them not to mislead the Captain on how drunk they were. Other station operation issues: Agents boarded drunk passengers and when asked they just responded that it is OK.'; 'Agents boarded drunk passengers and when asked they just responded that it is OK.

I looked up and saw a Cessna (not sure if 152 or 172); at our exact altitude; flying head on with us. The aircraft was probably less than 1/2 statute mile in front of us. I immediately took evasive action and lowered our altitude; while at the same time the plane veered hard to its left and our right.

RPIC advised the FAA representative; about his intentions for adding night operations was to be able to gain approval faster. The approval came in and the RPIC thought the timing was perfect and did not check the authorization start date on the authorization itself. He made the error because he was eager to be able to fly that area.The RPIC wanted to get the photos by deadline. The Operator was excited to have the COA in hand.

	["Captain performed the internal safety checklist; while First Officer performed the external walk around. Captain went over the trip can and sent out an ARCARS message requesting of the release.Once the release came out; Captain briefed Flight Attendants about the flight and informed the Flight Attendants about the following write up;-NE 25-XX-X : Emergency Equipment Compartment for gallery 2-MEL 21-XX-XX-X : Pack Flow Control Valve-MEL 21-XX-XX-X : Air Conditioning PacksCaptain informed the Flight Attendants about the inoperative pack 1 system and that would mean the pilots in the cockpit will have to adjust the air conditioning for the cabin and that if [flight attendants] need adjustments in the cabin; they should feel free to call the cockpit for the necessary adjustments.First Officer completed the external walk around and did not notice anything unusual during the walk around. Captain and First Officer went over the MELs; and discussed setting REF ECS on takeoff DATA to OFF in the MCDU and leaving the APU on during takeoff as MEL 21-XX-XX-X calls for. There was also an EICAS message; if I remember correctly; the EICAS message was 'RAM AIR FAULT'; which has to do with MEL 21-XX-XX which is a sub-part of MEL 21-XX-XX-X.First Officer then briefed the flight as he was the pilot flying and Captain was the pilot monitoring.Captain handed the paperwork to the gate agent and the doors were closed for an on time departure. Both pilots completed the before start checklist to the line and below the line. First Officer made a courtesy call to ground for push back; Aircraft X was cleared to push back at pilots discretion for Runway 17L and to call for taxi.Ramp crew gave the pilots the go-ahead to start the engines. First Officer started engine 1. It was a normal engine start; the tow bar and headset was then disconnected. Captain made a PA announcement and the after start checklist was completed. After start starting engine 2; a 'blue' EICAS message; if I remember correctly 'Pack 2 fail' came on; then extinguished after Captain pushed out and then pushed in the pack 2 button. Both pilots completed the taxi out checklist.Once cleared for takeoff; both pilots completed the before takeoff checklist; and lined up and wait. Captain then transferred the flight controls to First Officer . It was a normal takeoff. During the climb out; Captain (pilot monitoring) noticed that the APU was off. Crew discussed the APU should be turned back up as required by MEL 21-XX-XX-X for takeoff. Captain turned the APU back on. After completing the after takeoff check list; pilot monitoring turned off the APU. As we continued the climb; an EICAS caution message 'Bleed 2 overpress' appears. Pilot flying said; 'cancel and identify'. Pilot monitoring said 'bleed 2 overpress' and then referred to the QRH as called for by the pilot flying. After pushing out then in bleed 2 button; the EICAS message did not extinguish. Captain then viewed the ECS status page and noticed that both pack 1 and 2 had very low PSI. While performing the 'Bleed 2 Overpress QRH'; the PSI on pack 2 increases after cycling the bleed 2 button; but then drops down to a low PSI. An ACARS message was sent to Dispatch about the EICAS message; Dispatch responded that we should perform the QRH procedure. At that point; captain then turned on the APU; but the APU did not come online; an EICAS message 'APU fail' appeared; Captain then turned the switch to off and tried for the second time to turn on the APU but then got and 'APU fail' message; soon after that; 'CABIN ALTITUDE HI' EICAS message appears. At this point; Aircraft X was leveling at FL310.Both pilot donned the oxygen mask and established communication as the EPC calls for. Pilot flying said he has a loud squelching noise in the oxygen mask headset. Pilot monitoring could hear the pilot flying loud and clear.Pilot monitoring requested 10;000 ft. from ATC. ATC said he could not clearly hear the request. Pilot monitoring repeated the request. ATC said he still could not clearly hear the request. At this point; pilot monitoring was talking via the oxygen mask; this distorted the pilot monitoring voice. Another pilot from another airplane then repeated Aircraft X's request. The other pilot from another airplane said; 'they said they request 10;000 ft. due to cabin hi altitude'. At this time; ATC cleared Aircraft X to FL240.As we continued the descent; ATC could not clear Aircraft X below FL240 due to traffic. Captain [advised ATC] and asked for 10;000 ft. ATC then gave Aircraft X a heading and altitude of 10;000ft. As we continued the descent; pilot monitoring continued the EPC and referenced the QRH for the Cabin Altitude Hi. The pilots then talked to the flight attendants; who informed the pilots that all the oxygen mask but one (seat 4A) had deployed and used at the back. The 'dump button' was never pushed in and even though a PA announcement was made; the announcement did not include 'remove oxygen mask' as stated in the QRH. Both pilots decided to return back to ZZZ; Captain then requested vectors to ZZZ; ATC advised Aircraft X that ZZZ1 is closer than ZZZ. Captain then asked for the current weather at ZZZ1. The weather at ZZZ1 was reporting broken at 500 ft. and low visibility. The weather in ZZZ was a lot better than the weather in ZZZ1. ATC gave Aircraft X vectors to ZZZ. Captain also informed Dispatch that [priority handling was requested] due to Cabin Altitude Hi and Aircraft X is returning back to ZZZ. Dispatch then suggested diverting to ZZZ1 instead of ZZZ; after considering the current situation; which at this time; the cabin altitude had stabilized; Flight crew decided to divert to ZZZ1. Pilot monitoring then requested vectors to ZZZ1 and made a PA announcement about diverting to ZZZ1 due to having a maintenance crew out in ZZZ1 and also if necessary; a better chance to switch aircrafts. Approach checklist to the line and below the line was then performed; but the EICAS message 'Bleed 2 overpress' still remained.Control Rower vectored flight Aircraft X to ZZZ1 for the ILS approach XXR. After landing; Aircraft X was escorted to [gate] by the emergency truck. At [gate]; Aircraft X deplaned and egress was given.We switched airplanes and proceeded to ZZZ2.", {"entities": [[5178, 5185, "WEATHER"], [5199, 5206, "WEATHER"], [5255, 5265, "WEATHER"], [5271, 5278, "WEATHER"], [5312, 5319, "WEATHER"], [0, 7, "CREW"], [55, 68, "CREW"], [105, 112, "CREW"], [220, 227, "CREW"], [574, 580, "CREW"], [588, 595, "AIRPLANE"], [645, 650, "AIRPLANE"], [664, 681, "CREW"], [707, 712, "AIRPLANE"], [748, 755, "AIRPLANE"], [786, 799, "CREW"], [895, 902, "CREW"], [907, 920, "CREW"], [974, 981, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1001, 1005, "AIRPLANE"], [1022, 1025, "AIRPLANE"], [1036, 1043, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1091, 1096, "AIRPLANE"], [1135, 1140, "AIRPLANE"], [1294, 1299, "CREW"], [1311, 1318, "CREW"], [1327, 1332, "CREW"], [1344, 1351, "CREW"], [1380, 1384, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1448, 1454, "CREW"], [1524, 1537, "CREW"], [1623, 1629, "CREW"], [1696, 1702, "CREW"], [1738, 1751, "CREW"], [1760, 1766, "AIRPLANE"], [1786, 1792, "AIRPLANE"], [1847, 1854, "CREW"], [1862, 1864, "ABBREVIATION"], [1944, 1950, "AIRPLANE"], [1963, 1968, "AIRPLANE"], [2049, 2056, "CREW"], [2111, 2117, "CREW"], [2168, 2175, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2182, 2188, "CREW"], [2210, 2217, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2252, 2259, "CREW"], [2300, 2313, "CREW"], [2332, 2339, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2352, 2357, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2363, 2370, "CREW"], [2372, 2377, "CREW"], [2407, 2410, "AIRPLANE"], [2439, 2442, "AIRPLANE"], [2502, 2509, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2511, 2518, "CREW"], [2530, 2533, "AIRPLANE"], [2570, 2577, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2590, 2595, "CREW"], [2622, 2625, "AIRPLANE"], [2647, 2652, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2657, 2662, "AIRPLANE"], [2817, 2820, "ABBREVIATION"], [2842, 2847, "CREW"], [2848, 2854, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2902, 2907, "AIRPLANE"], [2936, 2943, "CREW"], [3069, 3072, "ABBREVIATION"], [3174, 3179, "AIRPLANE"], [3200, 3208, "CREW"], [3219, 3224, "AIRPLANE"], [3234, 3242, "CREW"], [3280, 3283, "ABBREVIATION"], [3310, 3317, "CREW"], [3337, 3340, "AIRPLANE"], [3350, 3353, "AIRPLANE"], [3378, 3383, "AIRPLANE"], [3393, 3396, "AIRPLANE"], [3413, 3420, "CREW"], [3496, 3499, "AIRPLANE"], [3518, 3521, "AIRPLANE"], [3574, 3579, "AIRPLANE"], [3639, 3649, "ALTITUDE"], [3650, 3655, "CREW"], [3840, 3845, "CREW"], [3846, 3852, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3895, 3904, "ALTITUDE"], [3911, 3914, "CREW"], [3916, 3919, "CREW"], [4003, 4006, "CREW"], [4072, 4077, "CREW"], [4141, 4146, "CREW"], [4173, 4178, "CREW"], [4247, 4252, "CREW"], [4305, 4314, "ALTITUDE"], [4323, 4328, "AIRPLANE"], [4357, 4360, "CREW"], [4383, 4391, "ALTITUDE"], [4409, 4416, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4418, 4421, "CREW"], [4455, 4460, "ALTITUDE"], [4477, 4484, "CREW"], [4494, 4497, "CREW"], [4513, 4522, "ALTITUDE"], [4524, 4527, "CREW"], [4575, 4583, "ALTITUDE"], [4605, 4612, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4614, 4619, "CREW"], [4668, 4671, "ABBREVIATION"], [4703, 4709, "CREW"], [4729, 4746, "CREW"], [4765, 4771, "CREW"], [4806, 4810, "AIRPLANE"], [4906, 4908, "ABBREVIATION"], [5003, 5006, "ABBREVIATION"], [5013, 5019, "CREW"], [5051, 5058, "CREW"], [5090, 5093, "CREW"], [5143, 5150, "CREW"], [5239, 5245, "ALTITUDE"], [5329, 5332, "CREW"], [5365, 5372, "CREW"], [5387, 5395, "CREW"], [5501, 5509, "CREW"], [5624, 5629, "AIRPLANE"], [5753, 5755, "ABBREVIATION"], [5809, 5820, "CREW"], [5898, 5906, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5976, 5981, "AIRPLANE"], [6082, 6094, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6143, 6147, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6177, 6181, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],
	["Departing ZZZ for ZZZ1. E6 Logbook contained a previous writeup about a FADEC overheat in flight. I do not know if Flight returned to airport or continued. Balancing write up by maintenance said FADEC was replaced. Aircraft worked well for taxi out and takeoff; we were heavy weight with about 4.5 to 5 hours of flying in front of us. We were talking to Center passing through FL280 when we received an ECAM warning of 'ENG 2 FADEC OVHT'. This aircraft was equipped with IAE engines. We followed procedures and noted this was a crew awareness. In flight only. Procedure was to retard thrust on effected engine. We asked Atlanta to stop climb at FL290; ran ECAM procedures and noted all engine parameters were correct. I elected to slow our Mach speed to reduce thrust a little and I contacted Dispatch and was patched in with Maintenance Control and my Dispatcher. Maintenance Control had two people talking with me because the first person 'had not of this before'. While this was going on I asked the First Officer to inform Atlanta that we were talking with dispatch and may return to ZZZ. Maintenance Control told me that MAYBE a cool duct was blocked and this was causing an OVHT. ( Pilots have no way of monitoring the temp of the FADEC or its components. Maintenance Control said just reduce thrust; if ovht continued then the FADEC would fail. I told Maintenance Control that I would talk with Dispatch. Because we still had 4.5 hours remaining inflight and that may include the need to reduce thrust to idle or an engine shutdown. Dispatch said maybe drop in ZZZ2 for a new aircraft but ZZZ2 was 654 miles in front of us and ZZZ 250 behind us. I elected to return to ZZZ. Atlanta coordinated with ZZZ and we asked for 36C. All engines were running well so I did not [request priority handling]. I told them this would be an overweight landing and requested that ARFF be standing by. An overweight landing in this aircraft requires that the APU be running; this is to increase available thrust for a go-around. We elected to start the APU at 10;000 ft. APU faulted. Continued with approach and tried once more for an APU start. Again it faulted. this now leaves us to shutdown packs for landing. First Officer landing was very nice and less than 200 fpm on touchdown. Taxied in. I communicated to the Flight Attendants Several times using the ' All Call'.

	["The morning started very normal with the boarding process and preflight checks. I performed the departure review and briefed that we were at [Gate XX] and an advisory pushback call was only necessary and no clearance was required; the gate next to us did require it due to its proximity to a taxiway. As boarding was finishing up the Captain gave dispatch a call and inquired about the GPS interference testing. He noticed that we were going to depart right as the testing began and most of the flight would be in the affected area. There were no NOTAMS in the release and the [company] memo didn't give any guidance on what the interference would look like or how to handle it if it occurred during our flight. Dispatch was not aware of anything so the Captain hung up and we finished our checks and began to pushback. During the push we began to discuss what we should do; what it may look like and if this was something we should look more into. As the ramp crew was finishing the push I heard ground say 'Aircraft pushing off [Gate XY] acknowledge'. I replied with our call sign and told them were pushing off [Gate XX]. Ground notified us that we had just been pushed onto an active taxiway and that we should have called to request pushback clearance. The Captain set the brake; waved off the ramp crew; and then let Ground know that we had read in our company notes it wasn't required from XX but that it was still our responsibility and apologized. Ground told us that the ramp crew should have known and then we carried on with the rest of the flight. Taxi out and takeoff resumed as normal. I believe the two main factors that lead to this was the distraction caused by the GPS interference and the fact that I became a little relaxed on being alert to pushing on taxiway after reading the note on the 10-7. After I briefed that clearance was not required from our gate I became complacent and just assumed the ramp crew would push us were we needed to go. On top of this; we got distracted during the push talking about the GPS interference which caused us to not make a courtesy call like we both would do normally and not to pay attention to where ramp was pushing us. I recommend the 10-7 page for ZZZ to be changed to include [Gate XX] as another gate that requires a call before push since it is so close to the active taxiway and if there are planes pushing to the left of it; the ramp crew is likely to push the aircraft in the taxiway.", {"entities": [[62, 71, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [167, 175, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [235, 239, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [292, 299, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [334, 341, "CREW"], [386, 389, "AIRPLANE"], [445, 451, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [712, 720, "CREW"], [754, 761, "CREW"], [810, 818, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [956, 960, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1125, 1131, "CREW"], [1188, 1195, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1238, 1246, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1262, 1269, "CREW"], [1299, 1303, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1323, 1329, "CREW"], [1457, 1463, "CREW"], [1481, 1485, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1574, 1581, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1684, 1687, "AIRPLANE"], [1774, 1781, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1875, 1879, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1921, 1925, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2035, 2038, "AIRPLANE"], [2161, 2165, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2262, 2266, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2335, 2342, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2398, 2402, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2446, 2453, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

	["Aircraft operated by First Officer with A/P in 'B' mode; vectoring from left downwind approach to Runway XXC. FOQA (Flight Operational Quality Assurance) hit graphic indicates whilst on a 30-45 degree intercept to the final approach course to Runway XXC and whilst at altitude descending from altitude 2;500 ft. to 2;000 ft. as directed by ATC. No aural alert received in the cockpit however; was notified next day by FOQA gate keeper of the GPWS FOQA advisory. Aircraft did not experience this. Altitude was correct per altimeter setting and following ATC instructions. No aural warning received in cockpit nor from ATC. Aircraft was fully within radar environment and control of ATC. Suspect an altitude calibration issue or other equipment anomaly with Aircraft X. Preceding leg while PIC and acting as Flying Pilot; Autopilot 'A' mode would not engage. Made note verbally that we would check and verify this when level off occurred. Due to short duration of the flight; we neglected to check this and continued the flight and subsequent approach to Runway XX at ZZZ. at approximate 300 feet; in Clear VMC conditions; a GPWS alert did occur advising 'Glide Slope.' Aircraft was on the ILS Glide slope and visual glide path indicator with a sink rate of 500-700 ft. per minute. All approach parameters were within limited and cross checked. Approach continued to landing well within touch down zone with no other abnormalities existing. The alert was dismissed as an erroneous message. Again the altimeter setting was correct and verified; no advisories were provided by ATC. Conversation on [date] with FOQA gate keeper regarding a false FOQA advisory about GPWS while on approach the following leg to ZZZ1 while in autopilot 'B' mode caused me to compare the two events and postulate that the autopilot 'B' computer may have a technical issue. Autopilot 'A' mode would not engage after takeoff during climb. Utilized 'B' mode and all operations normal for entire flight. Forgotten that 'B' mode was engaged and mistakenly did not write up anomaly of 'A' mode autopilot.

	["Unable to obtain clearance from departure airport in Doha; Qatar as flight planned for ZZZZ1 due to Saudi refusing our filed route. Doha relays the 'preferred' routing over the restricted gulf region. Dispatch unable to produce a [flight plan] with the preferred routing due to the NOTAM and performance engineering having more or less blacked out those specific routes in the software. Dispatch escalated and involves some of the duty pilots and managers while also speaking directly with Saudi; Bahrain; and Doha. Dispatch is able to refile us only by free text for the preferred route and ATC accepts the refiling. We obtain clearance and launch to ZZZZ1 without a valid signed [flight plan] in hand because there is no other possible way to do it. Dispatch can't even generate a new top sheet to send via ACARS for fuel planning purposes because of the block in the software. Thinking outside the box is the order of the day.  After departure; Doha vectors us off route straight toward Iran due to traffic congestion and says to expect to remain on that heading for 4 minutes. That time frame will put us well into Tehran. I inform Doha my intentions if that is what they expect to be their plan while also trying to mitigate that threat with Tehran ADIZ of which Tehran will not answer any radio calls. We initiate min clean speed at FL230 and prepare to declare MayDay if necessary at a specific point to justify a turn away from Iran. Min clean is approved and we are issued small step climbs higher. We are shortly turned back onto our route ultimately placing us within 10 nm of Tehran.

	["During climb around 10;000 ft. to 15;000 ft. the PIC first noticed the aircraft required an unusually high amount of left rudder trim. We then noticed the left wing tank had an amber caution imbalance and was about 1;500 lbs. lighter than the right wing tank. I asked the PIC if we were in balance before departure; and he reminded me that we both had verified the quantity and balance before taking the runway. We then passed our first fix on the fuel log and noticed we were 1;000 lbs. down. The PIC then continued to trim the aircraft to engage the autopilot; while asking me to retrieve the Fuel Imbalance Checklist from the QRH; which lead us to the Fuel Leak Engine checklist. Once I retrieved the checklist the PIC transferred control and radios of the aircraft to me for the duration of the flight. We then weighed our options. Because we were by now 2;000 lbs. light in our left tank and knowing there are not many airports between ZZZ and ZZZ1; we decided to return to ZZZ. As the Captain proceeded on with the checklist; he asked me to [advise ATC] and to start heading back to ZZZ. I asked Center for direct for the field; center then handed us off to approach. On initial check in I asked approach for straight in Runway XX; knowing that it was the longest runway with a headwind. Approach asked if we wanted the visual; I then asked for the RNAV Z Runway XX. Approach cleared us direct to TACOH to cross TACOH at 10;000 ft. and cleared for the approach. Somewhere in the process approach asked if we wanted ARFF standing by and I replied; 'affirmative'. Approach then asked for number of souls on board and fuel remaining. Meanwhile the Captain busy completing checklists; notifying flight attendants; and notifying company; informed me that the flight attendants had smelled fuel on departure. The flight attendants smelling of fuel helped us confirm that our decision to return to ZZZ was correct . Then on about a 5-10 mile left base for Runway XX; the Captain came to the part of the Fuel Leak Engine checklist that required us to shut down the left engine. We weighed our options. There was 5;000 lbs. of fuel in the left tank; the fuel leak had subsided at the low thrust setting; engine indications were normal; there was a lot of traffic in the terminal area (a missed approach wasn't out of the question); we were chose to landing; and we didn't want to do a single engine missed at a high altitude/high terrain airport. We decided to to leave the engine running and complete the decent and before landing checklist. We landed without event and I stopped the aircraft and transferred control of the aircraft to the Captain. The Captain told the passengers to remain seated as we retracted the spoilers and set flaps to 40. ARFF then advised us that there were no leaks or fire and followed us off the runway to the gate; where they boarded and checked on the status of the passengers. All of the passengers were fine. The entire flight from takeoff until touchdown lasted approximately 15 minutes. The Captain did an amazing job of delegating responsibilities among the crew while still keeping everyone in the loop. Although there was a lot to do in a short amount of time; I never once felt rushed or in the 'red'. I attribute this to the Captain setting a great tone on day one of our trip that promoted great team work and communication.\nOn departure; passing 10;000 ft. we noticed a rapidly growing fuel imbalance between wing tanks. Left was 2;000 pounds less than right tank. Sight right roll tendency was noticed. I passed control and comms to the First Officer. I contacted Tower to query about fuel venting from left wing. None noted. [Advised ATC] and initially leveled off. First Officer flew a return to ZZZ. I ran the fuel leak checklist; emergency landing checklist; briefed the Flight Attendants and made PA. notified Dispatch via ACARS. I had #1 (Flight Attendant) confirm no visible fuel leak on left engine/pylon and left wing areas. First Officer flew a flawless approach and landing to Runway XX. We stopped straight ahead for ARFF inspection; then taxied to gate with ARFF chase.I elected to not shut down the left engine and land based on the following- No visible indications of a fuel leak. All engine indications were normal throughout. Landing was to be conducted in mountainous terrain with high traffic volume. We agreed that with the above indications; the best choice was to land ASAP and not expose ourselves to higher risk of a single engine approach and landing.", {"entities": [[7, 12, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [20, 29, "ALTITUDE"], [34, 43, "ALTITUDE"], [160, 164, "AIRPLANE"], [249, 253, "AIRPLANE"], [404, 410, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [552, 561, "AIRPLANE"], [629, 632, "ABBREVIATION"], [991, 998, "CREW"], [1055, 1058, "CREW"], [1164, 1172, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1202, 1210, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1270, 1276, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1294, 1302, "CREW"], [1355, 1359, "ABBREVIATION"], [1373, 1381, "CREW"], [1427, 1436, "ALTITUDE"], [1458, 1466, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1493, 1501, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1568, 1576, "CREW"], [1651, 1658, "CREW"], [1697, 1714, "CREW"], [1760, 1777, "CREW"], [1813, 1830, "CREW"], [1946, 1950, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1970, 1977, "CREW"], [2068, 2074, "AIRPLANE"], [2201, 2207, "AIRPLANE"], [2267, 2275, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2284, 2299, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2389, 2395, "AIRPLANE"], [2471, 2477, "AIRPLANE"], [2543, 2549, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2638, 2645, "CREW"], [2651, 2658, "CREW"], [2824, 2830, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2838, 2842, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2964, 2971, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2978, 2987, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3025, 3032, "CREW"], [3264, 3271, "CREW"], [3387, 3396, "ALTITUDE"], [3450, 3454, "AIRPLANE"], [3579, 3592, "CREW"], [3606, 3611, "CREW"], [3650, 3654, "AIRPLANE"], [3677, 3680, "CREW"], [3709, 3722, "CREW"], [3723, 3727, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3844, 3846, "ABBREVIATION"], [3857, 3865, "CREW"], [3870, 3875, "AIRPLANE"], [3942, 3948, "AIRPLANE"], [3964, 3968, "AIRPLANE"], [3976, 3989, "CREW"], [3990, 3994, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4006, 4014, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4093, 4099, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4103, 4107, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4160, 4166, "AIRPLANE"], [4171, 4175, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4243, 4249, "AIRPLANE"], [4429, 4433, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4491, 4497, "AIRPLANE"], [4498, 4506, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["While attempting to line up properly with the DGS (Docking Guidance System); both I and the FO (First Officer) were literally unable to see the J line. I lined up with the DGS very slowly as best I could; and gingerly inched forward; stopping; and even illuminating the taxi light a few times. To no avail. Neither one of us could pick up the J line with certainty. The FO suggested calling for a Marshaller for better and safer guidance. I happily agreed; and with the marshaller's guidance we were able to correct our path to the J line which was in fact to our left. The FO notified the ramp ops of our exact difficulty and suggested that future crews parking at the gate that evening should be advised and offered the suggestion of a full compliment of marshallers.It had been raining in CLT most of the day; up to and including our arrival. There were a few periods of heavy rain in the surrounding hours of our arrival. At any rate; the rain wasn't in fact heavy for us; it was raining and the ramp was extremely wet and shiny looking. Something about this gate area and the surrounding terminal lighting just made it a bear to see the markings.I'm not sure exactly what the solution is; but I do think it needs to be looked at. The fact that both of us had such difficulty leads me to believe most others would have just as hard a time.  Though I'm sure all are crews would deal with it professionally; I don't think it's as safe as it could be with those conditions in the future. The FO was a great help to me; and on behalf of myself and all our other personnel; I appreciate it.  Looking back on it; though we believed it was safe to reposition with the marshaller's help; the safety margins could have been increased had I just shut down the engines and had a tug hooked up to us. Something I will very much consider if faced with such difficulty in the future.\nAfter a successful flight into CLT; we were arriving at the gate for parking. It was night and also raining. Between the dark; the rain; and the light from the flood lights reflecting off of the ramp; it was nearly impossible to see the lead in line and the safety zone lines. The DGS (Docking Guidance System) sign became active when we approached the gate. I expressed my concern with the Captain and asked him if he could see the line; and he could not. I suggested that we wait until we had a marshaller to continue to park. I called operations to ask for marshallers; but before I could ask; they walked out. It was at that point that we realized that we were far off to the right of being aligned. We swung to the left and finally could see the lead in line and safely taxiied the rest of the way into the gate with the help of the marshaller.

Instead of turning left on P3; I turned left onto L while taxiing east on S.While taxiing east on taxiway S after landing on Runway 9R; ATC initially instructed us to turn left on to Taxiway F and hold short of Runway 9L.  While taxiing on S; the FO (First Officer) contacted operations and learned that our gate was not available. Upon informing ATC that our gate was not open; we received a new clearance to turn left on P3 and hold short of P. Note on the diagram that between P and S near the east end of 9R; there are seven short connector taxiways that are immediately adjacent and parallel to each other. When I received the amended taxi instructions; I had already begun passing the westernmost group of taxiways. While looking at the taxiway signs for P3; I noted that the signs are located equidistant between the taxiways. As a result; it became unclear as to whether the taxiway sign was associated with the taxiway on the left side of the sign; or the right side of the sign. It appeared initially that the taxiway sign for P3 would be on the right side of the aircraft; but after making the turn I noticed that the in-pavement taxiway lights that were now visible further ahead (beyond P) continued across Runway 9L. Since P3 does not cross 9L; I now realized that I had turned one taxiway too soon. We contacted ATC to inform them of my mistake and they told us to remain where we were and to continue to hold short of P; which we did. There was no other traffic in our vicinity. Additional contributing factors include night operations and decreased level of familiarity with PHL due to limited experience there.Upon further review of the taxi diagram I noted that taxiway L was a left-turn only taxiway; while the P3 intersection also would allow a right turn onto S2.

	["Upon climbout from ZZZZ Runway XXR; we were assigned a climb to 7;000 feet MSL. We were in IMC conditions and light turbulence; and the First Officer; who was the Pilot Flying (PF); was also accelerating the aircraft from 200 KIAS to 240 KIAS. A few hundred feet before level-off at 7;000 feet MSL; ATC issued a clearance direct to a fix; and I; as the Pilot Monitoring (PM); selected direct to the fix in the FMS and activated the NAV mode on the flight control panel. The PF was flying the aircraft manually; the autopilot was not engaged. We climbed to approximately 7;200 feet MSL before I noticed the altitude deviation and took the yoke to correct our altitude. The Universal FMS coupled with the Honeywell Primus EFIS has a tendency to display erroneous information for a short period after selecting direct to a fix. It is common for the flight director to initially indicate a turn in the other direction at first; sometimes quite aggressively; before turning back to the correct direction to comply with the commanded direction. In this case; we were given a left turn direct to a fix; and the FD initially indicated a turn to the right. The PF then asked whether we were supposed to make a left or right turn; as I believe he was confused by the initial indication of the FD. It was during this time that the altitude deviation took place. It is my opinion that the primary cause of this event was the choice to hand-fly the aircraft on climbout at night and in IMC conditions from a field that was unfamiliar to the PF; however; the confusion introduced by the erroneous information provided by the FD cannot be discounted. Autopilot usage should be the norm when flying in night IMC conditions; barring a malfunction of the autopilot system there is simply no reason to unnecessarily increase the flight deck workload by hand-flying an aircraft in such conditions. Also; the issues present in the interface between the Universal FMS and Honeywell Primus systems should perhaps be investigated.

	["We were cleared to take-off Runway XXR via the RNAV Departure. At roughly 500 ft. AGL the First Officer called traffic ahead. The traffic was a helicopter hovering roughly 1;000 ft. AGL directly in the Runway XXR flight path for the SID. I observed the traffic visually and confirmed the traffic on my ND with an 'AMBER' TCAS advisory image at +600 ft. TCAS did not issue a RA; which it should have because the helicopter was directly in the lateral flight path of my aircraft. At this time I adjusted the vertical climb of the aircraft to pass directly beneath the helicopter. The First Officer advised Tower that there was traffic; at which time the controller issued the helicopter traffic to start a turn South. We passed beneath the helicopter roughly 500 ft. then I resumed the vertical profile of the SID. No lateral course deviations were taken at any time during the event. The rest of the departure ensued without incident. I asked the First Officer to inform ATC that the helicopter was really close to the flight path at this time; and that we would be filing an ASAP report. Suggestions: This incident could have been prevented if the VFR helicopter traffic had not been cleared to maneuver in the departing traffic flight path. Or; if we had not been issued a take-off clearance until the VFR traffic had cleared the flight path and had been referenced by ATC tower. The controller seemed to be task saturated since he was the only controller working in the tower that time of night. Perhaps this condition contributed to the lack of traffic coordination we observed.\nAfter calling for push back clearance on ground frequency; the controller asked me to call him on tower for taxi. It sounded like the same controller was working both frequencies. After being issued a takeoff clearance; a normal take off and initial climb were initiated. After I raised the gear and disarmed the spoilers; I noticed a red anticollision beacon and notified the Pilot Flying there was traffic at our 12 o'clock. I transmitted to Tower we had traffic at 12 o'clock and the Tower immediately transmitted to our traffic to start their southbound turn. Simultaneously the Pilot Flying lowered the nose to stop our climb and I noticed the TCAS was now displaying an amber target 800 ft. above us. There was no RA. The helicopter commenced its turn south and once we were clear the Pilot Flying re-established the climb and continued on the SID.I'm not sure I have a suggestion. I felt we responded appropriately (Seeing and avoiding).

I ran the performance numbers for a flaps full landing with ice speeds and we adjusted the landing speeds on the MCDU. In due course; we were cleared for the approach. The Captain set 1;700 ft. in the altitude selector for the FAF; and we were in LNAV and PATH until the fix prior to the FAF. At that point the vertical mode was changed to FPA. I believe at that moment the FPA was too steep; which eventually gave us the warning. At about 900 ft we received a 'caution obstacle' EGPWS warning. The Captain immediately adjusted the flight path; stopped the descent; continued his turn to follow the river visually after the FAF for XX; and we landed on Runway XX in ZZZ. Corrective Actions: In the future I will double verify the FPA setting after exiting VNAV and make sure it matches the chart so as to stay above any fixes between the FAF and MAP.\nWhile on final over the river in visual conditions during Runway XX LDA approach we received a momentary caution terrain alert while in the middle of the river. We broke out early on the approach. I configured the plane early with the landing gear down and eventually flaps full; I felt this was better as we were experiencing a 6 kt. tail wind for landing. Once we were established on the approach I asked for FPA of 3deg down and was following the path; it wasn't till we were receiving a momentary caution terrain that I noticed the FPA was at 3.8 instead of the three I asked for.

	["During an operational line check by [Instructor]. It was brought my attention that while covering all items on the checklist ; I did not physically have the checklist in hand to review.

The [aircraft type] Checklists are simple; and memorization occurs quickly with repeated flights along the same routes.This was an observation; not a detection.[Instructor] agreed that its almost too simple. Except that FAR Part 135 requires that the checklist be 'used' at all times during operations.

Listening for our call sign; automatically dialing in the next frequency; Using Beta and Braking unreasonably hard to make the first turn off are all potential places where things can and will go wrong when we become complacent.My personal recommendation is to place Card Stock (Not laminated) Normal Operations Checklists in the aircraft. If they get bent and beat up or get lost it means they are being used. Cheap to replace. Very Cheap. Using an Ipad for checklist is cumbersome at best. If you wear glasses; its an annoyance. and you have to either go back and forth from approach plate to checklist (go forbid you tap the wrong thing); or use multiple devices thus increasing rather than lessening the pilot workload.", {"entities": [[343, 350, "WEATHER"], [354, 357, "ABBREVIATION"], [673, 679, "CREW"], [967, 972, "CREW"], [1048, 1053, "CREW"], [1152, 1155, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1970, 1978, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2101, 2106, "CREW"]]}],
	["On initial climb it took a lot of left control wheel input to maintain level flight at slow speeds 250 kts. Once above 10;000 ft. we increased speed to Econ climb speed; control wheel inputs increased. The aileron trim had no effect on control column displacement. We had to use 7-8 Units of rudder trim displacement to maintain controlled flight at higher speeds with 7-8 units of rudder trim to the left; the control column was not centered. We still had 2.5 units of ailerons deflection to the left. I tried the autopilot but it also could not maintain controlled flight. We stopped our climb at FL230 and advised ATC we had mechanical issues and may need to return to ZZZ. ATC assigned us a heading to keep us out of [foreign] airspace. The First Officer and I assessed the situation. We slowed to 250 kts.; flaps were up no lights; gear was up no lights; spoilers were stowed no lights; yaw dampers no lights; engine thrust symmetrical; no vibrations; just 8 units of left rudder trim and control wheel 2.5 - 3.0 units to the left. We both were concerned about engine failure if we could control the aircraft with the rudder displacement we had. Our rudder pedals were also displaced to the left. We contacted maintenance for their input and was told to return to ZZZ. We contacted Dispatch via patch through Operations in ZZZ. Dispatch advised us to return to ZZZ. Dispatch also sent us an Acars message while in flight dealing with this [situation]; that they had another aircraft for us when we landed to take to ZZZ1. I don't think Dispatch realized the severity of our situation. I have all the Acars print outs if necessary. We then [requested priority handling] with ATC and confirmed we needed ATC to have the emergency equipment standing by. We advised the Flight Attendants we were returning to ZZZ because of a maintenance issue with our flight controls to prepare the cabin for a precautionary landing. I also advised the Flight Attendants they would see the emergency equipment with lights for a precaution due to our overweight landing. I made a PA to the passengers advising them we we're returning to ZZZ for a Maintenance Issue. The First Officer Completed all Required Checklists and Items as we returned to ZZZ. We made an overweight landing on Runway XX in ZZZ; 220;000 pounds; Flaps 30; 140 kt.s at touchdown; less than 200 ft. per minute at touchdown we landed with 5.0 units of left rudder trim with control wheel displaced 2.5 units to the left. Once we added flaps the roll to the left was even more severe. Aircraft X landed without incident. I am very thankful I had a very experienced First Officer on this flight with me. He was very calm and methodical and had 'Excellent' input working this [situation]. Once we arrived at the gate we removed the passengers. I then recorded in the AML the items we had on this flight. Also recorded the overweight landing . Maintenance came up to the flight deck with a sheet and advised us that they just re-rigged the rudder PCU's all of them and did not do a test flight. Maintenance stated that our rudder was way out of limits based on their data. Also that there was a previous AML entry such as ours. Maintenance stated they would take this to the hanger to fix and stated again our rudder rigging was way out of limits again. They also said they would do a test flight.

	["I was working Local Control when Aircraft X departed to the Southeast. The coordination on the VFR strip stated he was going to be headed to Kihei for fish spotting.

Meanwhile; Aircraft Y was on the RNAV Z approach to Runway 2; and was east of the airport on the right downwind. The 1200 code; which was Aircraft X; started to circle back towards the airport and appeared to be making a 5 mile straight in for Runway 2 as Aircraft Y was on a 5 mile right base. I picked up the binoculars and spotted Aircraft X pointed at the airport. I then noticed that Aircraft Y was high at about 3;600 feet. While this was taking place; the Cab Coordinator (CC) was on the line with approach discussing Aircraft X's priority status. Aircraft Y was being sent around. Aircraft X checked in on my frequency on about a 4 mile final. I cleared him to land Runway 2 and issued the winds at the approach end. He said he was unsure if he would be able to make it to the airport. I asked for the nature of his situation. He said his engine was in rough shape and it was not looking good. I advised him that rescue vehicles would be standing by. The Supervisor on duty worked to get a hold of crash fire rescue on ground frequency as well as the crash phone. Aircraft X's transmissions were coming in partially broken and it was tough to understand at times what he needed and what exactly the problem was. I issued a cautionary wake turbulence advisory for the Aircraft Y aircraft that had passed above him. Aircraft X landed safely on Runway 2 and exited at F to parking. He was met by rescue vehicles on the East Ramp. A follow up Runway inspection was performed by operations to make sure the Runway was clear of debris and ready for use. No separation was lost and all aircrafts made it to their destinations safely.During an emergency; it is important that everyone in the tower cab be made aware of the emergency and which aircraft is experiencing it. Although the cab coordinator and myself were aware of the emergency; and the OS and Ground Controller became aware of it from overhearing our conversation; it would have been more beneficial for both the CC and I to announce to the rest of the cab; that Aircraft X was inbound as an emergency. That way we acquire extra human resources who can help us safely handle the dire situation with many moving parts. I do not believe there was anything I could do to prevent the emergency; but I do believe that my coordination with my team members could have been better. I also think I could have slowed down the operations at the airport. While Aircraft X was inbound with the emergency; I was still departing aircraft.

	["Aircraft was at FL 360 and .78 mach when the auto throttles clicked off; we got two master warning lights; (No. 1 Engine) N1 rolled back to 45% and fluctuated. The aircraft started noticeably shaking. The First Officer was flying and pulled the number one throttle to idle; the shaking lessened but did not stop. I immediately started the APU. The flight attendants were ringing the cockpit; I had cabin now on my headset and could hear they were concerned the aircraft was shaking really bad in the back and that passengers were saying sparks and flames were coming from under the wing. I had already [advised ATC] and told them we had engine trouble. Ask them to stand by for further. I grabbed the QRC and started the ENGINE FIRE or ENGINE SERVER DAMAGE or SEPARATION check list. We did not have fire indications in the cockpit but with the shaking and reports of sparks and flames from under the wing I thought that the appropriate plan of action. I performed the checklist and First Officer flew the aircraft. We completed the first (few) steps on the QRC with in 2 minutes of the realization we had a major engine problem. After we had engine shut down I told ATC we needed lower that we had lost an engine and would get back with flight vitals. ATC told us we had ZZZ behind us we had a military base to our left and ZZZ1 straight ahead and asked out intentions. I quickly talk over with First Officer ZZZ was behind and about a thirty-minute spiral down to an unfamiliar military base; so decision was made for take straight in to ZZZ1. I completed the check list in QRH while First Officer flew and do normal radio. I coordinated with the flight attendants we had shut down the morning #1 engine we had [advised ATC] and that we were going to make a single engine landing in ZZZ1. I told them I would get back with the as far as the time to ETA and that we were not expecting an evacuation; I also told them I would make an announcement to the passengers shortly. I told ATC that we wanted the longest runway and to have safety vehicles to meet the aircraft at the runway about mid field. First Officer and I briefed the approach for Runway XX ZZZ1. We used a 1;000 fpm descent to allow descent rate with minimal power to maintain safe airspeed get the aircraft to 12;000 ft. about 20 miles from ZZZ1. I told First Officer I hope he didn't mind but I felt more comfortable landing the aircraft (this had no bearing on his ability his performance was stellar). At 12;000 ft. I took the aircraft and asked First Officer to verify all items on the check list were complete. We held off on the Grd Prox switch for the flaps 15 landing so we could keep out speed above 250 kts. Having First Officer verify items was to make sure this item and all others were complete; First Officer accomplished a non standard landing. I gave the cabin a 10 minute prep and a quick announcement for passengers before descending below 10;000 ft. Flew down wind slowing and descending to 3;000 ft. turned base at 12 miles. Completed a successful stable single engine landing on Runway XX ZZZ1. Stopped the aircraft at mid field. Told passengers remain seated three times. Safety equipment came to aircraft inspected entire aircraft were given the ok to taxi to gate. Safety equipment followed us to the gate without incident. In closing Cabin crew maintained professional calm attitude. More than effectively conveyed situation in the cabin to the flight deck so the best information was available. First Officer was stellar in his performance was level headed. He was task orientated focused and relayed information promptly and succinctly. He made sure I had all the information I needed to make decisions. This entire crew should receive recognitions for their duties preformed during this in flight emergency.\nAt FL 360 cruising to ZZZ the airplane started to shake noticeably and at the same time the auto throttle disconnected. Looking for clues the Flight Attendant called us reporting the shaking problem. The Captain and I realized the (No. 1) N1 dropped to approx. 45%; while the N2 was still around 85-90%; and a quick scan of the instruments nothing else out of the normal. The Flight Attendant called us the second time reporting passengers looking out the window saw sparking and fire below the left wing. We quickly realized we were losing the left engine. We [advised ATC] and we headed to ZZZ. We complied with the appropriate check list and descended to a lower altitude. We requested the longest runway in ZZZ (Runway XX) and the assistance from [crash fire rescue] on the ground. I flew the airplane while the Captain finished the check list and prepared the cabin crew for the emergency landing and he did the PA to the passengers. After that; the Captain flew the airplane and accomplished the landing at ZZZ on Runway XX runway. We stopped the aircraft on the runway and verified with [crash fire rescue] that the aircraft was safe to taxi to the gate.", {"entities": [[2943, 2947, "WEATHER"], [3358, 3362, "WEATHER"], [16, 18, "ABBREVIATION"], [205, 218, "CREW"], [223, 229, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [339, 342, "AIRPLANE"], [348, 365, "CREW"], [383, 390, "AIRPLANE"], [398, 403, "AIRPLANE"], [582, 586, "AIRPLANE"], [611, 614, "CREW"], [637, 643, "AIRPLANE"], [665, 670, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [823, 830, "AIRPLANE"], [900, 904, "AIRPLANE"], [982, 995, "CREW"], [996, 1000, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1113, 1119, "AIRPLANE"], [1142, 1148, "AIRPLANE"], [1166, 1169, "CREW"], [1206, 1212, "AIRPLANE"], [1252, 1255, "CREW"], [1303, 1307, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1395, 1408, "CREW"], [1488, 1492, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1575, 1578, "ABBREVIATION"], [1585, 1598, "CREW"], [1599, 1603, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1618, 1623, "AIRPLANE"], [1648, 1665, "CREW"], [1698, 1704, "AIRPLANE"], [1721, 1724, "CREW"], [1766, 1772, "AIRPLANE"], [1850, 1853, "ABBREVIATION"], [1980, 1983, "CREW"], [2011, 2017, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2074, 2080, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2098, 2111, "CREW"], [2130, 2138, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2179, 2186, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2196, 2203, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2274, 2283, "ALTITUDE"], [2318, 2331, "CREW"], [2382, 2389, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2472, 2481, "ALTITUDE"], [2513, 2526, "CREW"], [2677, 2680, "ABBREVIATION"], [2689, 2702, "CREW"], [2773, 2786, "CREW"], [2835, 2840, "AIRPLANE"], [2905, 2915, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2922, 2931, "ALTITUDE"], [2933, 2937, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2960, 2970, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2974, 2982, "ALTITUDE"], [2991, 2995, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3046, 3052, "AIRPLANE"], [3239, 3243, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3247, 3251, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3289, 3293, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3421, 3426, "AIRPLANE"], [3485, 3498, "CREW"], [3803, 3805, "ABBREVIATION"], [4004, 4011, "CREW"], [4256, 4262, "AIRPLANE"], [4300, 4304, "AIRPLANE"], [4350, 4356, "AIRPLANE"], [4370, 4373, "CREW"], [4445, 4454, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4501, 4507, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4588, 4592, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4616, 4623, "CREW"], [4665, 4675, "CREW"], [4717, 4719, "ABBREVIATION"], [4755, 4762, "CREW"], [4763, 4767, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4830, 4836, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4869, 4875, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4944, 4948, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4956, 4960, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

	["An initial attempt to make the landing resulted in descent below minimums and past the point at which an extraction procedure became mandatory. The autopilot was disconnected and all appropriate calls were made; manual speeds; heading mode; and 'activate' for the pre constructed extraction procedure. When the FO (First Officer) was told to activate; all navigational functions disappeared. Within 2-3 seconds the decision was made to begin the extraction procedure per SOP. The pre-built extraction procedure and the back up waypoints were removed; uncommanded by the crew. Although terrain displays were up and functioning; the extraction and the back up extraction waypoints and guidance were not visible. As the Captain and Pilot Flying; I made the decision to follow the missed approach overlay which was still visible on the MFD and was hand flown. This was based on a risk assessment which would have involved guessing on the extraction waypoints using only terrain mapping; and in consideration of the aircraft's loading and performance which was maximized by a light payload and low temperature. Terrain high points were looked at and the published missed approach waypoints and minimum altitudes; along with the approach MSA were also considered. Improved ground visibility existed along the missed approach path; while hard IMC conditions existed along the extraction procedure. A normal diversion to the listed alternate was completed.Part of the cause is still unknown; why the waypoints and the backup fixes would disappear are not understood. It is believed that the FO hit the auto throttle button instead of the heading button at the time of commands coming when descending below minimums; which started a confusion chain reaction with both pilots; beginning with a rollback of thrust which was immediately overridden. Night conditions along with the disablement of the installed witness lights made it impossible to quickly determine the error. Having to look at the FMA to confirm flight mode activation takes eyes out of the flight deck windows and into the EFIS. At low altitude on an extraction procedure; it is impossible to do with any degree of accuracy.Both Captains and FOs should receive some simulator training for ZZZ that includes extractions; FMS failures; along with a combination of engine failures during those procedures; and in night and IMC conditions. While Captains receive a specific check out for ZZZ operations; FOs do not and frequently the Captain is completing ZZZ IOE at times when FO proficiency must not be in question. The witness 'active mode' lights should be reactivated and properly trained as they were installed by the aircraft manufacturer; most likely for a reason. Additionally; initial and recurrent training should focus on the pilot's normal bidding routes in addition to other Company and FAA mandates. It is simply useless to spend hours flying visuals into ZZZ when the pilot is based in a location and at a seniority that means they are not flying into those locations but into high mountain airports where single engine missed approaches and avionics failures are not going to be assisted by ATC.

Should I have stopped the operation and maybe caused a possible further 1 hour delay to wait for catering to bring me 'hopefully a clean cart'?

The First Officer and I talked about it very briefly for less than a minute as we tried to identify what the smell could be. As the fumes increased in intensity; I commanded the crew to go on oxygen. The First Officer continued to fly the aircraft and I opened the QRH to the Smoke; Fire or Fumes checklist. We notified ARTCC and asked to land at the nearest suitable airport.  ARTCC recommended ZZZ2. We evaluated that as a good destination.  ARTCC immediately gave us a vector direct and a decent. With changes to the FMC for the diversion and approach; we were able to get to step 20 in the QRH checklist as we approached 10000 feet. I elected at that point to concentrate on safely navigating and flying the aircraft to the approach and landing at ZZZ2 and did not have time to proceed further in the QRH. I did have time as we passed 12000 feet; to very briefly pull my mask slightly away from my face and sample a short breath of air from the cockpit to see if 'Smoke or fumes continue or are increasing' as stated in the QRH. The fumes were still present.  At no time did the crew notice visual indications of smoke. To expedite our decent and maintain an expedited profile to ZZZ2; we did go above 250 KIAS below 10;000 feet.  At approximately 4000 feet we were below 250 KIAS.

The crew noted the same fume smell again as we exited the cockpit; but not in the aft compartment as we left the cockpit and approached the L1 door. We opened the L1 door; and because we did not smell fumes at that position; to avoid injury; we elected to use the air stair that the fire department had immediately available outside the aircraft. In the past; I have had electrical fires on aircraft that have the smell of ozone. That was not the smell. It was also not a petroleum type smell. I can only characterize it as an acrid chemical smell that I have never encountered before. I cannot say for sure weather it is a smell associated with a chemical fire or simply chemical fumes.\nDuring climb out about 15 minutes after departure while climbing through about FL340 both the Captain and I noticed a non-normal odor on the flight deck. This odor to me reminded me of a similar smell I have encountered in my past when I was flying an aircraft for a different operator that had burning insulation on miscellaneous wiring. After assessing the smell for about a minute; the decision was made to don oxygen masks and divert to the nearest suitable airport. At no point; did I see any visible smoke. As it was my leg flying; I had the aircraft and also took the radios so the Captain would work on running the QRH. I notified Center and advised them with the nature of the emergency and advised that we would need to divert to the nearest airport. Center advised that ZZZ2 was nearby and the Captain and I agreed that ZZZ2 would be the best option. We are given a heading and a descent as we turn towards ZZZ2. Meanwhile the Captain I had started working through the 'Smoke; Fire or Fumes' QRH section. At some point in QRH the crew is directed to see if the fumes are increasing. I stayed on O2 the entire time as I was Pilot Flying and the Captain stated that the smell of the unknown fumes had in fact increased in intensity. As we are in an expeditious descent as pilot flying; I had kept the speed at above 250 KIAS under 10000 FT as a part of our emergency authority to get the plane on the ground in the soonest amount of time. We set up for the ILS into ZZZ2 and were given vectors to the final approach course and tracked the ILS in for a normal landing. After touchdown; a left turnoff the runway was made and after the parking brake was set; the 'Evacuation Checklist' was completed. As we leave the flight deck and head towards the L1 door; I noticed that there was no odor aft of the cockpit door. We vacate the aircraft via a set of mobile airstairs and wait as the fire crew clear the aircraft.

	["During climbout at about 10 minutes after departure while climbing through about 15;000 feet the Captain noticed the same non-normal odor on the flight deck experienced two days prior. We called the mechanic who was on our jumpseat up to try and locate the source of the odor. After about a minute of not being able to locate the source of the odor; we sat the mechanic down and donned oxygen. It was apparent that the issue had not been fixed and a source of the odor could not be readily determined; we advised ATC. We are given a heading and a descent to return to ZZZ. As I was the pilot flying; the Captain started working through 'Smoke; Fire or Fumes' QRH and once completed; the descent and approach checklists. As we are in an expeditious descent as pilot flying; I had kept the speed at above 250 KIAS under 10;000 feet as a part of our authority to get the plane on the ground in the soonest amount of time. We set up for the ILS into ZZZ and were given vectors to the final approach course and tracked the ILS in for a normal landing. After touchdown; a right turnoff the runway was made and after the parking brake was set; the 'Evacuation Checklist' was completed. We vacate the aircraft via a set of mobile air stairs and wait as the fire crew clear the aircraft. During the postflight; the mechanic onboard deemed that the source of the odor was near the Captain's overhead panel and possible from the wiring harness associated with the window heat system.\nBetween approximately 5-10 minutes after takeoff; during climb; and while climbing through 15;000 feet; the First Officer and I noticed an acrid smell in the cockpit. The First Officer and I; called the supernumerary mechanic forward to help identify the source of the fumes. The three of us; identified the location as primarily on the left side of the cockpit. The three of us talked about it briefly as we climbed; but could not clearly identify the location and affected system. The smell became more noxious to me as the fumes increased in intensity; I commanded the crew to go on oxygen. The First Officer continued to fly the aircraft and I opened the QRH to the 'Smoke; Fire or Fumes' checklist. We advised ATC; leveled off at FL200 and asked for an expedited descent and return to ZZZ.Center immediately gave us a vector direct to ZZZ and a descent. With changes to the FMC for the diversion and approach; we were able to get to step 24 in the QRH checklist as we approached 4;000 ft. I elected at that point to concentrate on safely navigating and flying the aircraft to the approach and landing at ZZZ and did not have time to proceed further in the QRH. I did have time as we descended; to sample the air to see if the fumes were continuing; increasing; or decreasing in accordance with the checklist. At each point in the checklist; I very briefly pull my mask slightly away from my face and sampled a short breath of air from the cockpit to see the condition of the fumes as indicated in the QRH. The fumes were still present; but decreasing very slightly at each check. At no time did the crew notice visual indications of smoke.To expedite our decent and maintain an expedited profile to ZZZ; we did go above 250 KIAS below 10;000 feet. At approximately 7;000 feet we were below 250 KIAS.We were given priority handling with vectors to Runway XX at ZZZ. The approach was flown and landed normally. The aircraft safely exited the runway at the first available taxiway. The aircraft was stopped immediately after clearing the runway. The crew ran the Evacuation checklist; where crash fire rescue personnel and equipment met the aircraft. The crew noted no fume smell as we exited the cockpit. We opened the L1 door; and because we did not smell fumes at that position; to avoid injury; we elected to use the air stair that the fire department had immediately available outside the aircraft.In the past; I have had electrical fires on aircraft that have the smell of ozone. That was not the smell. It was also not a petroleum type smell. I can only characterize it as an acrid chemical smell that I have only ever encountered on this aircraft; the day before under the same conditions. I cannot say for sure weather it is a smell associated with a chemical fire or simply chemical fumes.On post flight; after the fire department declared the aircraft safe; the supernumerary mechanic began a more thorough inspection from a sitting position in the left pilot seat. He was able to locate the area directly above the left forward window as the source of the smell; by putting his face directly against the panel covers overhead the window. On further inspection with the aircraft powered in the ramp parking; with panels removed; the mechanic believes he found the source to be the wiring harness for the windows; however these findings are very preliminary and should not be relied on until further maintenance action; and investigation.", {"entities": [[3111, 3116, "WEATHER"], [3954, 3959, "WEATHER"], [4195, 4202, "WEATHER"], [58, 66, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [81, 92, "ALTITUDE"], [97, 104, "CREW"], [513, 516, "CREW"], [547, 554, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [586, 591, "CREW"], [592, 598, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [604, 611, "CREW"], [659, 662, "ABBREVIATION"], [687, 694, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [699, 707, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [748, 755, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [759, 764, "CREW"], [818, 829, "ALTITUDE"], [937, 940, "ABBREVIATION"], [980, 994, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1018, 1021, "ABBREVIATION"], [1053, 1062, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1084, 1090, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1371, 1378, "CREW"], [1453, 1459, "AIRPLANE"], [1514, 1521, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1530, 1535, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1547, 1555, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1564, 1575, "ALTITUDE"], [1581, 1594, "CREW"], [1631, 1638, "AIRPLANE"], [1644, 1657, "CREW"], [1827, 1834, "AIRPLANE"], [1882, 1889, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2071, 2084, "CREW"], [2098, 2101, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2132, 2135, "ABBREVIATION"], [2188, 2191, "CREW"], [2208, 2213, "ALTITUDE"], [2241, 2248, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2323, 2330, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2378, 2386, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2426, 2429, "ABBREVIATION"], [2446, 2456, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2457, 2465, "ALTITUDE"], [2531, 2537, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2558, 2566, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2634, 2637, "ABBREVIATION"], [2661, 2670, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2917, 2924, "AIRPLANE"], [2979, 2982, "ABBREVIATION"], [3213, 3224, "ALTITUDE"], [3243, 3253, "ALTITUDE"], [3347, 3355, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3360, 3365, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3370, 3376, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3418, 3424, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3448, 3455, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3513, 3519, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3672, 3679, "AIRPLANE"], [3698, 3702, "AIRPLANE"], [4440, 4445, "CREW"], [4446, 4450, "AIRPLANE"], [4515, 4521, "AIRPLANE"], [4617, 4623, "AIRPLANE"], [4680, 4684, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4885, 4896, "CREW"]]}],

Below 4;500 feet. we encountered continuous moderate turbulence along with wind shear. We also encountered what we perceived as wake from the B737. We delayed flap selections several times during the descent for wildly fluctuating air speeds. We had ref speeds increased due to icing conditions during the descent. We were fully configured at around 1;500 feet AGL. We heard the B737 go-around. Somewhere between 1;500 and 1;000 feet we encountered a wind shear; maybe two; maybe several that caused instant fluctuations in airspeed from stick shaker to flap 35 max speed exceedance in less than 1 second. Then another. I saw the acceleration cue plus 30; then minimum speed cue; all in under a second.The auto pilot disconnected on its own and the First Officer decided to go around. I was in agreement and said so. It was a very busy missed approach; even though it was begun above 1;000 ft. During the vectoring and climb portion; it became evident that [two other air carriers] and ourselves had all executed missed approaches and were being resequenced for second approaches.All 3 of those approaches were successful; including others. We did encounter another abrupt; but instant stick shaker about 400 ft. AGL. I had already added a generous amount of power prior so that event was about as long as an eye blink. We continued the approach to a successful landing. We had a short discussion about our fit to fly condition for the following flight. We both agreed that we had enough time to properly detune and de-amplify from our previous arrival. The duty officer asked us the same question a short time later. Good on them for doing so.Little did we know that our arrival into [our next destination] an hour later was going to be a repeat of earlier that day. We had; again; easily comparable one of the most challenging wind shear and moderate turbulence events in my career. Had we known...If someone told us we had to go repeat what we had just been through; surely we would have declined.The wind shear detection equipment [at destination] has been out of service for several weeks now. The timing seems inappropriate. The reports from other aircraft were timely. We have to remind those who are unaware that 15 to 20 kt oscillations from another aircraft can equal 25 to 30 in the Q400; its airspeed tape fluctuates wildly compared with other 121 aircraft.On the second attempt the First Officer said he was okay with a second attempt; but subsequently decided it would be better for me to make the second attempt.

Touchdown was under control and on rollout at approximately 25 mph a 30+ knot crosswind came from the right and the plane veered to the right into the grass and made contact with an electrical meter on the right side of the road with minor damage to the electrical meter and the mid way down; midway across; underneath the right wing tearing the fabric surface and slightly bending the trailing edge of the wing. Electrical box is fully functional with cosmetic damage to the top cover. I pulled off the road and contacted the neighbors and was given permission to tie down the airplane to the property owners fence for as long as I needed and within a couple of hours returned to push the plane into a secure area next to a house until further action.

	["Prior to the safety event there were factors contributing to the identification of the incident.LPAZ called and the Supervisor advised that AIDC [an automated process that accomplishes required ATC facility to ATC facility flight coordination.] had failed. I had over 10 aircraft in pending approval status with LPAZ. The priority at this time was to now verbally coordinate aircraft in close proximity to the boundary. After being told this I immediately advised the CIC that I needed my sector split; and that the AIDC failure had occurred. After passing several aircraft I received an override call from sector 65 with east bound initial coordination. There were complications in this coordination as well due to specific profile adjustments that weren't automatically forwarded from sectors 65s data to my data. At this time I realize that my sector queue has grown significantly and have to terminate the call with LPAZ with a few pending coordination's not accomplished. After quickly scanning the messages I get information urgently from the CIC that an aircraft has contacted ARINC/NY Radio and that Aircraft X is holding at position FISST. The aircraft was not cleared to hold by NY or TTZP and was acting on his own. The aircraft advised that they were doing this because they did not receive the Oceanic Clearance required to Enter Oceanic Airspace. This Oceanic Clearance only takes effect at 27n entering HLA not at 18n. Secondly this clearance is required to be issued by TTZP as part of the LOA between facilities. Since Aircraft X has now held over FISST company 15mins in trail is rapidly closing. The CIC coordinates with me while on the phone with ARINC to clear the aircraft to continue along his route. It appears the Aircraft X was 6mins in front of Aircraft Y at the time the clearance was issued to continue on previously cleared route. Once I was able to establish where the Aircraft X really was via his ADS-C report I immediately cleared them to FL400 and called ARINC to issue and immediate clearance to Aircraft Y to FL380. Aircraft Y was not on ARINC Freq and had not checked in; but I advised that the clearance needed to be sent as soon as practicable and they were reaching out to see if the plane was on any freq at the time.Also other notable contributions to sector complexity are the fact that the DLM had debuted this week and the building was not prepared for this even though Support Staff here knew this was going into effect and they had known of its implementation since 2011 yet proper measures; contingencies were not developed.Because of this the Oceanic areas had increased workload and are all operating under Article 65 of the Current CBA.Under no circumstances should [controllers] be allowed to let aircraft enter the expanded boundary of ZNY without receiving their Oceanic Clearance.In the Published NAT message ZNY attaches citations to the ICAO 444 and the AIP for the FAA that explicitly outline that all aircraft are not to hold without a clearance to hold from ATC (which is in those documents) Also the NOTAM system the FAA uses needs to be kept current and/or the Oceanic Clearance Procedures from the FAA be added or updated. Also those procedures for Oceanic Clearance be added to the published NAT message to users every day. Aircraft still to this day ask NY and NY Oceanic for an Oceanic Clearance that as far as the FAA is concerned they have already received. This may mean that ZNY puts out a specific NOTAM to all Users reminding them of the FAA Oceanic Procedures. It's been years since a route; has been issued by a ZNY Radar Controller to every aircraft entering Oceanic because it is no longer required yet pilots have not comprehended the procedure that the FAA developed; that is a major problem.", {"entities": [[1763, 1768, "WEATHER"], [194, 197, "CREW"], [210, 213, "CREW"], [1122, 1129, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1973, 1978, "ALTITUDE"], [2046, 2051, "ALTITUDE"], [2895, 2899, "ABBREVIATION"], [2924, 2927, "ABBREVIATION"], [3019, 3022, "CREW"], [3062, 3067, "ABBREVIATION"], [3079, 3082, "ABBREVIATION"], [3162, 3165, "ABBREVIATION"], [3382, 3385, "ABBREVIATION"], [3470, 3475, "ABBREVIATION"], [3511, 3514, "ABBREVIATION"], [3597, 3607, "CREW"], [3680, 3686, "CREW"], [3732, 3735, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

	["Inbound crew from ZZZ1 noted nothing abnormal about aircraft on arrival.  Due to weather delay at ZZZ1 and subsequent maintenance delay for an unrelated fuel leak from left wing water drain; aircraft was cooled by APU bleed air for roughly 3 hours with nothing unusual noted.   We switched off the APU roughly 15 minutes before departure and operated on engine bleed air with nothing abnormal noted. Shortly after takeoff; I began to notice an odor I would describe as a musty wet sock smell coming from the air ducts and commented to the Captain.  We both felt it may have been something in the air around ZZZ.  Passing 10K; the lead Flight Attendant contacted us about a strange odor in the cabin.  I asked him if he noted any smoke or other vapor; he did not.  I asked if he or anyone else was feeling ill; he said no; but that the Fight Attendants in back felt hot.  I turned all temperature control knobs full cold and the Captain selected high flow.  I told the lead Flight Attendant to notify us if he or anyone began to feel illl.  I checked the air conditioning; electrical; bleed air; and pressurization pages; all were normal.  We had no ECAM notifications and all systems appeared to be operating normally.  The Captain and I noted the odor seemed to lessen as we climbed and approached cruise altitude; so we continued.  I elected to don my oxygen mask as a precaution.  We both referenced the smoke/fumes & removal of smoke/fumes checklists [80.1 &amp; 80.16) in the QRH as a precaution.  We did not feel the situation warranted actions recommended in either checklist; particularly since the odor appeared to be dissipating.  We continued to ZZZ1; but noted a return of the smell as we began our descent; so I made an MRM entry noting a musty wet sock smell.  We landed uneventfully and I immediately started the APU; transitioned to APU bleed air; and shut down the engine bleeds.  We noted an improvement in the smell after this was done.  We informed maintenance & the outbound crews of our concerns.  Maintenance informed us that this aircraft had a history of this situation.  We noted there was nothing in the maintenance section of the flight plan regarding unusual odors and that the inbound crew did not note anything unusual.\nThe inbound crew noted no defects. Our flight was delayed due to weather in ZZZ1 and a ground stop; so the aircraft was cooled by the APU for about three hours.  The APU was shut down after second engine start shortly before takeoff from ZZZ.  After takeoff and climbing out of ZZZ the we both noted an unknown faint odor and commented that it could be smog.  Climbing through 10;000 feet noted that the odor it was still present and seemed like a wet sock or gym like odor. No smoke; fumes; or other abnormal indications were present.  We established contact with the purser/lead flight attendant who reported that he also could smell the odor and it seemed to be throughout the cabin.  The lead was asked to investigate and report any smoke; vapors or fumes; any complaints of feeling ill; and relay any information from the other flight attendants as well.After a short while the odor seemed to dissipate but was still perceptible. Further contact with the lead flight attendant confirmed that the odor was dissipating but still perceptible in the cabin and the aft cabin was reported as having a warm air temperature; so we took steps to cool the cabin.   The flight attendants were advised to keep us informed of any changes; or if the odor strengthened or any other changes occurred. No smoke or fumes were evident in either the cabin or the cockpit. There were no abnormal system indications or EICAS messages. (Electrical; Hydraulic; Engine; ECS; etc. were all normal).  Although still perceptible; the wet sock smell seemed to be going away and under control.  As a precaution; we reviewed the Smoke/Fumes QRH and Smoke/Fumes removal QRH but did not execute as there was only the lingering odor that was continuing to dissipate.  The first officer did don his oxygen mask for a time as a further precaution. We did not feel that since the odor seemed to be dissipating and under control; the Smoke/Fumes removal QRH was necessary at that time.  We elected to continue the flight.At cruise we contacted the lead flight attendant on three occasions;and he continued to report that the odor was lingering and perceptible but not increasing; and no other changes or feelings of illness reported.  Descending through approximately 6;000 ft on approach and until touchdown the odor returned and continued to be present and strengthening on short final until landing. At this point we were already cleared the visual to XXL at ZZZ1 positioned to land immediately. We continued to a normal landing.  After landing we switched to APU bleeds and the odor began to dissipate quickly. The odor did not return but was noted by the technician who met the aircraft.  We did not feel that there were fumes present; just the annoying odor.  The condition was entered in the log and maintenance was briefed. The maintenance technician asked he cockpit and cabin crew to fill out forms indicating specific engine; pack indications; whether the aircraft had been deiced; ground air used; engine; hydraulic fluid levels; etc.The technician informed us that the aircraft had a history this although there was no note of this in the recent log history.After the flight the flight attendants all noted that when the odor returned on the approach; it was stronger than before.  While they reported to us during the flight that they did not experience any feelings of illness; now that it was over they felt it would be a good idea to get a medical checkup in ZZZ1.The FODM was briefed as soon as practical after the flight.   Although fumes were not selected above as an element of this report; it was our determination that it was more of an odor and did not reach the strength of a fumes definition or event.", {"entities": [[81, 88, "WEATHER"], [729, 734, "WEATHER"], [884, 895, "WEATHER"], [1407, 1412, "WEATHER"], [1432, 1437, "WEATHER"], [2316, 2323, "WEATHER"], [2604, 2608, "WEATHER"], [2729, 2734, "WEATHER"], [2988, 2993, "WEATHER"], [3360, 3371, "WEATHER"], [3544, 3549, "WEATHER"], [118, 129, "CREW"], [173, 177, "AIRPLANE"], [214, 217, "AIRPLANE"], [298, 301, "AIRPLANE"], [354, 360, "AIRPLANE"], [414, 421, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [539, 546, "CREW"], [693, 698, "AIRPLANE"], [928, 935, "CREW"], [1149, 1153, "AIRPLANE"], [1224, 1231, "CREW"], [1276, 1283, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1288, 1298, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1299, 1305, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1481, 1484, "ABBREVIATION"], [1711, 1718, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1778, 1784, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1828, 1831, "AIRPLANE"], [1849, 1852, "AIRPLANE"], [1882, 1888, "AIRPLANE"], [1969, 1980, "CREW"], [2020, 2031, "CREW"], [2131, 2142, "CREW"], [2385, 2388, "AIRPLANE"], [2417, 2420, "AIRPLANE"], [2448, 2454, "AIRPLANE"], [2476, 2483, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2501, 2508, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2513, 2521, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2611, 2619, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2628, 2639, "ALTITUDE"], [2832, 2848, "CREW"], [2931, 2936, "AIRPLANE"], [3084, 3101, "CREW"], [3216, 3232, "CREW"], [3302, 3307, "AIRPLANE"], [3320, 3325, "AIRPLANE"], [3402, 3407, "AIRPLANE"], [3415, 3432, "CREW"], [3586, 3591, "AIRPLANE"], [3599, 3606, "AIRPLANE"], [3653, 3658, "AIRPLANE"], [3866, 3869, "ABBREVIATION"], [3894, 3897, "ABBREVIATION"], [3994, 4007, "CREW"], [4172, 4175, "ABBREVIATION"], [4242, 4248, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4271, 4287, "CREW"], [4453, 4463, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4486, 4494, "ALTITUDE"], [4498, 4506, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4517, 4526, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4699, 4703, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4758, 4765, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4781, 4784, "AIRPLANE"], [5025, 5036, "CREW"], [5054, 5065, "CREW"], [5086, 5093, "AIRPLANE"], [5098, 5108, "CREW"], [5147, 5153, "AIRPLANE"], [5228, 5234, "AIRPLANE"], [5410, 5427, "CREW"], [5473, 5481, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["We were attempting to park the aircraft at Gate XX; Terminal X at ZZZ. While taxiing; we lined the aircraft on what was thought to be the correct line. We had the Digital Guidance System (DGS) at Gate XX that indicated [our make/model aircraft] but we were getting no feedback from it. Upon realizing; that we were on the incorrect lead-line; I stopped; set the brake and had the First Officer request a tug crew to push us back and pull the aircraft to the gate on the correct lead-in line. The error was corrected without any equipment damage or interference with other traffic on the ramp.The reason for this error was due to the fact that we could not see the lead-in line because it was night; raining and the wet ramp reflected the light so brightly that all markings on the pavement were 'masked'. We taxied in based on what looked to be the proper perspective due to the position of the DGS sign as well as the orientation of the jet bridge. We thought that the line would come into view along with feedback from the DGS once we got closer. However; that was not the case. We briefly followed the dashed lined for wide body aircraft. By the time the mistake was realized; we were too close to move the aircraft onto the correct line without ramp assistance. Lastly; I didn't pay full enough attention to detail on the Jeppesen chart. This chart depicts an accurate overlay of the ramp area at Terminal X. It clearly shows an offset lead-in line to Gate XX. While doing my arrival briefing I overlooked that detail.Well; we probably should have just stopped while we were far out on the ramp and asked for three marshallers. Most importantly; one to ensure that we were going to be aligned correctly. Even though we had DGS at our gate; I would recommend that the ramp staff continue to direct the crews in at night; especially when it is raining. Those lead-in lines; or J lines as they are sometimes called; are very faint and nearly impossible to see at night or at anytime when it is raining. The standing water on the ramp reflects the light. Therefore; it is difficult to see where the line is; even during the daytime. Also; I would recommend that the current lead-in lines be repainted. That would definitely help make them more visible. Finally; I will make a more thorough review of the Jeppesen Chart which depicts an offset line.", {"entities": [[22, 26, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [77, 84, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [380, 393, "CREW"], [458, 462, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [587, 591, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [719, 723, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [765, 773, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [808, 814, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1249, 1253, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1388, 1392, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1594, 1598, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1738, 1742, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1771, 1775, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2030, 2034, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],
	["I was the PM (Pilot Monitoring) and my FO (First Officer) was the PF (Pilot Flying). On taxi out; after being deiced; we received an intermittent L JET OVHT FAIL caution message. The message went away as quickly as it showed up on ED1. We complied with the QRH and considered it a transient anomaly and continued with the flight. On climb out; we received several more of the L JET OVHT FAIL caution messages. Once again the messages went away as soon as they appeared. As we continued the climb out of 10;000 to 12;000 ft.; we received an L JETPIPE OVHT warning message; which went away as quickly as it showed up on ED1. As a precaution; we ran the QRH for the warning message and reduced the thrust enough to maintain the climb and to reduce the risk of getting another warning message. We continued our climb to FL270 and still had a few recurring L JET OVHT FAIL caution and L JETPIPE OVHT warning messages; but not as frequently as we had before we reduced the thrust on the engines.When we reached the cruise phase of the flight; we decided to slow the aircraft down to 250 kts. to reduce the ITT on the engines (around 667 C). Once the thrust levers were pulled back all intermittent indications L JETPIPE OVHT warning messages stopped. We were then given a clearance to descend to FL240 and; upon reaching that altitude; we once again received an L JETPIPE OVHT warning message; but this time it stayed on. I noticed that my FO had added power to maintain airspeed (around 84% N1) and this took the ITTs above 700 C. I instructed my FO to reduce the thrust on the left engine and he said that it was at idle.The L JETPIPE OVHT warning message persisted and I was very concerned that the JETPIPE of the left engine was overheating when the ITT was above 700 C. We ran the QRH again and it led us to make the decision to shut the engine down. I decided that shutting the left engine was the safest thing to do because of the indications we saw when the thrust on the L engine was increased for normal flight. The QRH specifically states to Complete 'In Flight Engine Shutdown / Engine Failure' if the L JETPIPE OVHT warning message persists.We completed the In Flight Engine Shutdown followed by the Single Engine Approach and Landing checklist. I then notified ATC of the nature of the problem; souls on board; the amount of fuel remaining and that we would like [airport rescue and fire fighting] to stand by. I gave my FA (Flight Attendant) a brief and told him that we had a Yellow Emergency and to expect a normal landing and no evacuation.We were given direct [to the airport] where we made a visual approach to landing without incident. I took the controls about 10 miles out to make the landing. After clearing the runway; we requested [airport rescue and fire fighting] to inspect the left engine and all indications came back normal from their visual and instrument observations. We continued to the gate; deplaned the aircraft and made the necessary write-up.I want to commend my First Officer for remaining calm and doing an excellent job in this situation. He has a great attitude; works very hard; and is eager to learn.I believe excessive deicing fluid contaminated the L Jet Pipe loops. This contamination generated an L JET OVHT FAIL Caution Message that was very intermittent and was considered a transient anomaly.On climb out; we had a L JETPIPE OVHT Warning message that was thought to be erroneous due to the brevity of the EICAS message. We did run the QRH and reduced the thrust enough to slow the frequency of the EICAS warnings.In the cruise phase of flight we decided to slow the aircraft to 250 kts. as a precaution to keep the ITT down on the left engine. This action quieted the Caution and Warning messages for the duration of the cruise phase of flight. My thinking was if we kept the ITT down on the left engine we could continue the flight safely on both engines and address the maintenance concerns on the ground.We were given an initial descent down to FL240 and upon reaching that altitude we received a continuous L JETPIPE OVHT Warning message. I initially thought the EICAS message would go away but this time it stayed on and seemed to come on above 700 C. My concern at that point was that something was very wrong with the engine to generate a continuous OVHT Warning message every time the ITT on that engine was above 700 C. This new information along with the guidance of the QRH influenced my decision to shut down the left engine in flight.In my judgment; the safest course of action was to shut the engine down at altitude and continue to the destination single engine where we could plan on and execute a stable approach to landing at the destination airport. I wanted to reduce the risk of having an in flight fire or dealing with multiple threats of fire; go around; and possible engine loss close to the ground. None of our decisions were rushed and were made in a controlled and calculated effort that enhanced safety; managed the threat; and kept the aircraft from entering into an undesirable aircraft state.I have nothing to add at this time until the root cause is identified.\n[The] only abnormal [condition] for the flight was a bit of frost on the aircraft. As a safety precaution my Captain and I decided it was best to de-ice the aircraft with type 1 fluid. After we were finished deicing we continued out to the runway where we received our first L jet ovht fail caution message. I proceeded to get out the QRH; confirmed it with my Captain and complied with it. At the end of the checklist we both determined we are safe to continue with the flight per the steps in the QRH. After taking off around 10;000 ft. we got our first L jetpipe ovht warning message.At this point I was the pilot flying and the Captain took out the QRH and began the procedure. The first step was to reduce the thrust levers for a lower ITT and the warning message went away. So we continued the flight and decided it would be best to keep the speed at 250 with a low power setting to keep our ITT lower. Once we started our initial descent out of FL270 for FL240; in the descent the jetpipe ovht warning message came back and my Captain told me to reduce power as he got out the QRH at which point I informed him I was at flight idle.From that point he continued with the in-flight engine shutdown QRH and then the single engine approach and landing QRH and prepared and briefed the single engine landing at which point we talked about I would continue to fly the plane until we got close to the airport at which point he would take over the aircraft and land the plane. He execute the single engine landing and Airport Fire and Rescue met us off the runway and confirmed we were clear and we continued taxi to the gate and deplaned as normal.My best guess at the cause would be some de-ice fluid made its way into the aircraft's engine housing and caused faulty indications.", {"entities": [[3026, 3030, "WEATHER"], [39, 41, "ABBREVIATION"], [43, 56, "CREW"], [257, 260, "ABBREVIATION"], [333, 338, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [490, 495, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [513, 522, "ALTITUDE"], [651, 654, "ABBREVIATION"], [725, 730, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [807, 812, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [816, 821, "ALTITUDE"], [1009, 1015, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1081, 1084, "ABBREVIATION"], [1279, 1286, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1290, 1295, "ALTITUDE"], [1434, 1436, "ABBREVIATION"], [1542, 1544, "ABBREVIATION"], [1578, 1584, "AIRPLANE"], [1716, 1722, "AIRPLANE"], [1780, 1783, "ABBREVIATION"], [1837, 1843, "AIRPLANE"], [1883, 1889, "AIRPLANE"], [1976, 1982, "AIRPLANE"], [2020, 2023, "ABBREVIATION"], [2221, 2229, "CREW"], [2269, 2272, "CREW"], [2409, 2414, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2606, 2621, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2625, 2632, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2730, 2736, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2806, 2812, "AIRPLANE"], [2917, 2921, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2998, 3011, "CREW"], [3343, 3348, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3453, 3458, "AIRPLANE"], [3483, 3486, "ABBREVIATION"], [3546, 3551, "AIRPLANE"], [3568, 3574, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3630, 3633, "ABBREVIATION"], [3684, 3690, "AIRPLANE"], [3769, 3775, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3845, 3851, "AIRPLANE"], [3920, 3931, "CREW"], [3980, 3987, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3996, 4001, "ALTITUDE"], [4115, 4120, "AIRPLANE"], [4273, 4279, "AIRPLANE"], [4353, 4359, "AIRPLANE"], [4429, 4432, "ABBREVIATION"], [4478, 4484, "AIRPLANE"], [4555, 4561, "AIRPLANE"], [4618, 4624, "AIRPLANE"], [4669, 4677, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4681, 4688, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4815, 4824, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4839, 4845, "AIRPLANE"], [5251, 5258, "CREW"], [5382, 5388, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5477, 5480, "ABBREVIATION"], [5503, 5510, "CREW"], [5641, 5644, "ABBREVIATION"], [5652, 5662, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5670, 5679, "ALTITUDE"], [5753, 5758, "CREW"], [5774, 5781, "CREW"], [5795, 5798, "ABBREVIATION"], [6079, 6086, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6094, 6099, "ALTITUDE"], [6104, 6109, "ALTITUDE"], [6118, 6125, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6176, 6183, "CREW"], [6226, 6229, "ABBREVIATION"], [6329, 6335, "AIRPLANE"], [6345, 6348, "ABBREVIATION"], [6369, 6375, "AIRPLANE"], [6376, 6384, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6397, 6400, "ABBREVIATION"], [6437, 6443, "AIRPLANE"], [6503, 6506, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6602, 6606, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6640, 6646, "AIRPLANE"], [6698, 6704, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6762, 6766, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6877, 6883, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["While enroute ZZZ1-ZZZ Flight Attendant A became aware of the emergency floor level lighting was damaged and completely dead what white in color with damage and had stains and what looked to be dark liquid trapped under the plastic covering. A call was made to the flight deck to notify them of the issue and the location was pilots' side first 5 feet of the system spanning from exit to row 3. When we landed; we asked the pilot if he saw what we were talking about and he said he would wait till ZZZ2 to write it up. I called a duty officer as I thought that this was something that needed attention as I had the same exact issue 1 week prior on a different plane. Pilots are under the impression that the system only matters during non-daylight hours. This is a misconception as it still has to be functional for smoke fill cabin. The pilot was urged to write it up and MEL the strip which I questioned as it was such a large section that was damaged. I still was questioning how it could be MEL. I did not see the explanation in the pilots Manual for the MEL. When we landed in ZZZ2 I still was bothered and questioning the write up and why? At this point we were swapping crews and we were already late and new pilots were getting on. I wanted to talk to the cap again about the write up so that I could better understand the reason why it was able to be differed. We had started boarding but I chose to question the Mel because I felt it was important. Captain was super understanding and pulled up the info and we read it together and upon reading it again he understood my concern and said let's call Maintenance and have a talk and see what they say. When you first read the info it says no more the 10% of any section can be damaged or non-functioning? What is a section? It wasn't clear a section is a part not the whole system and is 5 feet 10%? A picture was taken and sent to Maintenance and immediately the decision was made that it was a no go and needed to be fixed. We had passengers on board and had to deplane. A first class passenger was very upset and screamed at me that I didn't great him and I was the absolute worst flight attendant. I apologized and said I'm very sorry I was dealing with something that was safety related and I apologize. He then screamed for everyone to hear it's not your job and shook his finger. I was shaken and taken aback and almost brought to tears. First Officer; Captain and gate agent all were witness to this. I was questioning myself and my speaking up at that point. It's hard enough to challenge something but to be yelled at for put further doubt in my head. In the end I feel like I did the right thing to question why and to understand the 3 departments that come together to make these decisions and how maybe something so small as emergency lighting is important to flight attendants but not as concerning to Maintenance or pilots . Will the plane fly without it? Yes. Is it safe? In my opinion no. The other concern is who is ensuring that the strips are cleaned and maintained? This was the 2nd plane in a week that had the same section fail. Is no one paying attention to the strips? Thank you for your attention and thought to this small but important issue.A better understand of functions of cabin emergency equipment on the pilot's side as a common answer to it not working was its daylight and it's ok.

Thinking I was dealing with a software problem; I started troubleshooting. The equipment is only linked to the airplane by the alternator; which charges it. After my attempts to fix what I thought were a problem with the imaging equipment failed; I turned my attention back to the panel. My scan showed a discharge indication on the alternator. My next reaction was to verify that I was below gear extension speed; and lower the gear lever. The landing gear only extended about halfway down. I ran through the checklist; and pumped the gear down manually. Although I had followed the procedure; I was not getting a green light due as there was not enough power to illuminate it. I headed toward ZZZ2; and called the tower on my cell phone. We arranged a low pass; and everyone in the tower cab agreed they were down and locked. I then climbed out and held over the ZZZ2's VOR. I again reviewed the checklist and everything in the POH; as well as a few 210 training manuals I keep in the airplane. My knowledge of these airplanes told me that if I had followed the procedure; the gear should be down. As a precaution; I called an A&P familiar with 210s; and he agreed that this was the case after conferring with several other people. At that point; I called ZZZ2 Tower again; and was cleared for an uneventful; no-flap landing. After some ground troubleshooting; it was confirmed that the alternator was the likely cause. A replacement alternator seems to have fixed the issue.Contributing Factors;The failure of the low voltage warning lightMy unfamiliarity with the aerial survey equipment; which could have been used as a backup voltmeter. The low voltage indication I was looking at was indicating that the survey equipment was not receiving power from the airplane.My fixation on troubleshooting individual problems; rather than recognizing an alternator failure immediately.This is a valuable lesson; as a similar chain of events could have led to a dangerous situation in IMC. For example; a pilot with a vacuum failure might fixate on troubleshooting a vacuum driven autopilot; and be in an unusual attitude before recognizing the true nature of the situation. It is better to assume the cause of a problem is the worst possible answer; and work backward from there. Useful Lessons;Cell phones are a valuable tool. While a handheld radio is great; unless you have one that can be wired to a headset it is loud; and the range usually isn't great. A cell phone works just as clearly as a radio; and once paired with a bluetooth headset requires no additional input. Controllers are more than willing to help work a problem. I was very impressed with how everyone in the Palm Springs Tower handled the situation.Keep a backup battery to power cell phones with you.

A line mechanic would just insert the bolt and we could reset all the open CB's (Circuit Breakers). I refused and made a write ups for the bolt and the breakers; because it needed to be documented that the plane was returned to service (green) in this condition. This is not the first time I've been assigned a plane that came from the hanger and was placed online before maintenance procedures were complete.

It concerns me that every time I have a questionable Maintenance situation Maintenance Control always tries to say everything is fine just go.

Yes; that is needed to run the PACs after engine shutdown in order to provide air conditioning in the cabin; but we should have waited a few minutes to allow the engine fumes to dissipate.First of all; I need to review the procedure involving the use of the APU bleed air after shutdown. I knew the procedure then. But; the rather awkward situation that we were in at that time caused me to forget for about 30 seconds; which was just enough time to cause the fumes to be sucked into the cabin by the APU intake. Secondly; I should have insisted that the flight attendants see the Paramedics. However; since they deplaned rather quickly and did not request them; the First Officer and myself did not feel that it was necessary.", {"entities": [[50, 53, "AIRPLANE"], [66, 72, "AIRPLANE"], [91, 98, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [106, 110, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [122, 126, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [214, 219, "AIRPLANE"], [257, 267, "CREW"], [309, 326, "CREW"], [472, 489, "CREW"], [583, 596, "CREW"], [703, 707, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [715, 723, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [805, 812, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [912, 915, "AIRPLANE"], [1001, 1004, "AIRPLANE"], [1054, 1060, "AIRPLANE"], [1114, 1119, "AIRPLANE"], [1174, 1180, "AIRPLANE"], [1270, 1273, "AIRPLANE"], [1500, 1505, "AIRPLANE"], [1513, 1516, "AIRPLANE"], [1567, 1584, "CREW"], [1679, 1692, "CREW"]]}],
	["During passenger boarding a catering representative placed two carrier boxes filled with dry ice right in front of the boarding door; stating that the crew should take this on the aircraft because of an inoperative chiller. The crew was; at that moment not aware of any inoperative chiller on the aircraft.

The two carrier boxes posed a significant tripping hazard to our customers boarding; but the catering representative refused to remove the carrier boxes; stating that the flight attendants should take them on board. The carrier boxed where too heavy to lift; and it is my understanding that we should not carry heave carrier boxes full of dangerous goods through an aircraft with customers on board. An In-flight Supervisor was in the area and was unhelpful in resolving this dangerous situation. While I was trying to have these carrier boxes with dry ice removed; this Supervisor displayed aggressive behavior and stating if I was refusing the dry ice and taking a delay. He was unwilling to listen or understand the problem with having two carrier boxes full of dry ice being placed in front of the boarding door while customers were boarding. At this point I was informed by the Captain that chiller number 7 in the aft galley had an issue and the fuse was pulled. No one informed the crew about this.

	["Aircraft X reported on the Local Control frequency having seen a drone pass off of the right hand side of the aircraft on final Runway XX Left. The Local Assist Controller advised me and began looking through their binoculars to see if they could observe the drone. The Local Controller advised the subsequent traffic inbound to ZZZ and the Local Assist advised TRACON finals sectors. The traffic was fairly busy with moderate complexity. At the time I was monitoring Ground Control as there was a chance of having no gates for arrivals as well as repositions for overnight aircraft servicing. I picked up the CIC binder which spewed itself onto the floor because someone had left the rings partially open. Having to put the binder back together took some time and eventually I found the section about UAS unauthorized activity. I started an report; had Ground Control check with the pilot about additional information; and the pilot asked for the number to provide the details. The pilot called a few minutes later and provided all the details that were requested on the form. I then followed up with a call to TRACON; Center; DEN (Domestic Event Center); and finally the ROC (Regional Office Center) due to the significant nature. I was assigned the CIC (Controller in Charge) due to the remaining present controllers all being ineligible. There were 3 late staying people on break; of which two were CIC eligible. I am not sure how the FLM (Front Line Manager) got out of the shift and a CIC always assigned. 3 of us were in the last 90 minutes of a 10 hour day. When calling into the ROC; it was mentioned that I should not be in charge of the operation as well as doing the paperwork. I paused and thought to myself that is a set up for operational failure in a situation like this. This was definitely an operationally urgent notification; as any subsequent report of the drone would shut down the arrivals until we could establish it was safe to do so once again. There was one follow-up sheet of questions that I waited until the late staying controllers came back and give up CIC to take care of.While filling out the report and making the calls; I was no longer actively engaged in monitoring the operation; however I could hear everything that was going on in the background. The team worked remarkably well with Local Control reporting the drone activity for almost an hour; and the Local Assist continually looking to see if they could see it; even though when the pilot called in it was described as unlit.Looking at the event in review; I can see the checklist is great for guidance and there were some really important elements to cover; as this was a very unusual event. Getting the ATIS done; having Local broadcast; notifying TRACON; the airport; and the DEN are all important. I was very happy to follow up and complete the processes; but it kind of bothers me that with all of these great check lists and all; when I called the ROC the QCG (Quality Control Group) person told me if I should not do this without direct monitoring of the operation; then leave it for tomorrow. I don't think that it is very realistic to get the very specific recallable details and information conveyed as this was an aircraft security event. Next time I will call a CIC capable controller back from break to fill out the paperwork and make the calls; and let them figure out the breaks after I go home since the worst case scenario would be about 2 hours and 25 minutes until a mid shift person was able to come and get them out.", {"entities": [[161, 171, "CREW"], [276, 286, "CREW"], [362, 368, "ABBREVIATION"], [468, 474, "CREW"], [854, 860, "CREW"], [884, 889, "CREW"], [928, 933, "CREW"], [983, 988, "CREW"], [1112, 1118, "ABBREVIATION"], [1257, 1267, "CREW"], [2478, 2483, "CREW"], [2700, 2704, "ABBREVIATION"], [2745, 2751, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

I had normal rest having been awake 12 hours and a duty start time of XA:00 with an event at XG:20.", {"entities": [[39, 49, "WEATHER"], [3, 11, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [129, 136, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [140, 147, "ALTITUDE"], [152, 160, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [226, 233, "ALTITUDE"], [332, 347, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [534, 542, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [566, 571, "CREW"], [604, 610, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [637, 644, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [675, 683, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [713, 720, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [838, 844, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [881, 889, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [984, 991, "ALTITUDE"], [993, 996, "ABBREVIATION"], [1028, 1031, "ABBREVIATION"], [1198, 1205, "ALTITUDE"], [1239, 1243, "AIRPLANE"], [1282, 1290, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1373, 1379, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1594, 1599, "AIRPLANE"], [1711, 1716, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["During the after takeoff check my finger got jammed between the APU and right generators. This resulted in turning both generators off. Alarmed; I had a reflex action and spontaneously tuned the left generator off. This happened without any thought and I don't know why I did this. These actions resulted in deployment of the ADG (Air Driven Generator). After deployment; I reset all three generators on and transferred emergency bus power back to the left generator.  With power restored; we executed the ILS XXR approach; taxied and parked.\nAfter takeoff; while climbing towards the assigned initial altitude of 5;000 feet on the assigned SID; the Captain (the pilot monitoring); turned off all AC power to the aircraft while performing his after-takeoff flow. Power was restored within seconds; but the ADG (Air Driven Generator) had already dropped. The Captain announced to Approach Control that we were going to need to return to the field. As the pilot flying; I continued to maintain positive aircraft control while the Captain tried to configure the cockpit for a return to the departure airport. After power was restored and I could see the AC synoptic page; I was able to add back in the autopilot automation to help reduce my workload and piece a plan together with the Captain to return for a landing.As the pilot flying; there was not much for me to do but aviate; navigate; and keep a watchful ear to the radio communications that the Captain was having with Approach Control. It was unbelievably stressful; and the level of task saturation was high for both of us. To the best of my abilities; after the situation had calmed down a bit; I tried to mentally load shed and stay focused on flying the jet to a successful landing from the abnormal situation.When a pilot accidentally creates an unanticipated abnormal situation; like the one described above; there is a massive startle effect. So much so; that you almost don't know what to do for a few seconds because it is so surprising. The loss of all AC power on climb out is not a scenario that you practice in the simulator. During initial type rating training; you may see it; but when it happens in the airplane while climbing through IMC conditions; it's completely unexpected. So much so; that I had to ask the Captain what the noise was; at which point; he identified that it was the ADG (Air Driven Generator). I had only heard the sound one time before in the simulator; it was not a sound that I was able to immediately identify in flight. I suggest that this scenario be used in some way for future pilot training so that same thing doesn't happen again to another crew.", {"entities": [[1545, 1555, "WEATHER"], [17, 24, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [64, 67, "AIRPLANE"], [506, 509, "ABBREVIATION"], [514, 522, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [524, 530, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [535, 541, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [549, 556, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [564, 572, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [614, 624, "ALTITUDE"], [641, 644, "ABBREVIATION"], [650, 657, "CREW"], [663, 668, "CREW"], [749, 756, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [858, 865, "CREW"], [879, 887, "CREW"], [954, 959, "CREW"], [1028, 1035, "CREW"], [1059, 1066, "AIRPLANE"], [1199, 1208, "AIRPLANE"], [1282, 1289, "CREW"], [1321, 1326, "CREW"], [1420, 1425, "AIRPLANE"], [1450, 1457, "CREW"], [1474, 1482, "CREW"], [1703, 1709, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1777, 1782, "CREW"], [2031, 2036, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2190, 2198, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2285, 2292, "CREW"], [2578, 2583, "CREW"]]}],
	["On flight from IAH-ZZZ we experienced extreme turbulence. We were at FL350 in the vicinity of SQS VOR. There were cells showing up on the aircraft radar from around our 10 o'clock to around 1 o'clock. We opted to go south as that looked like a better option based on what we could see outside; and with the radar. Memphis Center told us there were reports of nothing more than light to moderate chop. We requested right deviations for weather; and Center cleared us. We began working south to get around the weather that was painting on the aircraft radar. We were in and out of IMC as well. A few minutes after we began going south; we broke out of a layer and saw a cell that WAS NOT painted on radar and ATC did not say anything. I had less than 10 seconds to tell my Flight Attendants to hold on. There was not enough time to turn. The cell was too wide in both directions to attempt turning away from it. Without radar showing it; we had no idea how big or what direction this cell was going; which contributed to this entire situation. If I had tried to turn away from it in either direction; we would have entered the cell in a bank. As soon as we hit the cell; it was immediate extreme turbulence and extreme precipitation. The autopilot and auto throttles disengaged. We first ended up in an updraft resulting in a significant loss of airspeed. My First Officer was flying the plane. I did help him out by putting the thrust levers to max power to keep the aircraft from possibly stalling. As the updraft ended; we went into a very severe downdraft. At this point we got rolled into a 40-degree bank and lost around 1000 ft. in altitude. At this point I had to take the controls to get the aircraft back to straight and as level as possible. I brought the power to idle to try to stop the airspeed from getting out of control. The fastest speed I remember seeing is .83M; which resulted in an over speed warning. The best I remember; we got the over speed warning twice. Once we got the aircraft stable and the turbulence began to subside; Memphis Center asked what our altitude was. I told them we had extreme turbulence and that we were indicating FL343. They gave us an altitude block from FL340-FL350. Once we were stable we climbed back to FL350. After I knew the aircraft did not appear to have any significant damage; I attempted to contact my Flight Attendants. They did not answer the interphone after multiple attempts. I also made a PA asking them to please call the flight deck if possible. There was nothing. I tried using both the regular and emergency interphone to reach them. Since there was no answer; I opted to move my seat back and crack the flight deck door open. I only opened it far enough so I could try to see what was going on in the cabin. I did not lose grip of the door handle. As soon as I opened it; my Flight Attendant 1 was right there by the door. The best I could tell he was kneeling on the floor. He said everyone was okay; and that they attempted to call the flight deck; but there was no answer. Once I knew everyone was okay in the cabin; I concentrated on trying to figure out a plan of action in terms of diverting; returning to IAH; or continuing to ZZZ. After running a present position directly in the FMS; I found it was longer to return to IAH than to continue to ZZZ due to the winds aloft. I was also trying to reach Dispatch on [Commercial Radio]. I had a hard time getting through. Once I finally got through to them; I told them the situation and they passed the information along to Maintenance Control who said we will be safe to continue to ZZZ. I stated my concern of going that far to my Dispatcher; and I was told my two options are to continue to ZZZ or go back to IAH. I asked about possibly going into ZZZ1; but dispatch said the weather was IFR and not good. I took a minute to think it over; and decided I would cautiously continue to ZZZ. The aircraft seemed to be flying well and was trimmed out like normal. I did not feel like we had any structural damage. I was also prepared to divert if we felt anything go wrong with the aircraft. We flew at .76M or slower if needed; and avoided every cell we possibly could. During all of this conversation with dispatch; my First Officer was working comm 1 and talking to ATC. They said rides were better down at FL270. I told my First Officer to request it and descend once cleared. I was watching everything he was doing; and confirming the altitude. Once we got below around FL290 we got into moderate turbulence and heavy precipitation. FL270 was not a good ride. We requested to climb back to FL350 where the ride was better; but still light chop. Once I got all of this situated and we had a plan of action; I made a PA to the passengers telling them we apologize for the turbulence and we are safe; and will continue on to ZZZ. I also told my Flight Attendant's to remain seated for the duration of the flight. After this episode; the ride was not bad. We deviated for some weather west of BKW; but the ride was overall good. About 35 minutes out of ZZZ; both my First Officer and I had to take a restroom break. When I took my turn; I did a quick walk through to the aft galley to check on my passengers and my Flight Attendant 2. Everybody seemed to be doing okay. We continued into ZZZ without further incident. Once we got to the gate; I called Dispatch and began the process with maintenance control of writing up the aircraft as required. As far as passengers; I was only aware of the flight of one passenger who says he hit his head; but my Flight Attendant also told me this passenger did not have his seat belt tightened. They gave him an ice pack. After we got to ZZZ; I was informed that two more passengers were complaining of hurting. He was in row 23. One said he hit his knee; and the other said his back was hurting. These two were both in row 24. Nobody requested EMS. That is all of the passenger injuries I was aware of as of last night.\nUpon arrival into ZZZ after our extreme turbulence event on cruise; we landed on Runway XX into ZZZ. ATC instructed us to taxi via G; G; hold short of J and advise. We did that. They asked if we contacted ramp for clearance. We said no. They said contact ramp for clearance to enter and advice. We could not find the ramp freq. I asked ground what it was. They gave it to us. We called ramp and were told to give way to another [Company] aircraft and taxi lane 7 to the gate. As they pushed off; I thought I had room to go around the left side of them and get into the gate. I had to stop on taxiway A because I knew we could not fit into the gate with the other [Company] aircraft on our right side. Thankfully the ramp crew acted quickly and had us park at gate 45 which I had no problem getting into. After parking; the gate agent brought me a phone number to contact the Tower. The controller basically said everything we did was not ZZZ procedure; and also that the ramp Tower instructions were not clear and correct. I apologized and continued dealing with my more serious issue from the turbulence encounter.", {"entities": [[46, 56, "WEATHER"], [435, 442, "WEATHER"], [508, 515, "WEATHER"], [652, 657, "WEATHER"], [1194, 1204, "WEATHER"], [1217, 1230, "WEATHER"], [1301, 1308, "WEATHER"], [1506, 1513, "WEATHER"], [1548, 1557, "WEATHER"], [2020, 2030, "WEATHER"], [2120, 2130, "WEATHER"], [3801, 3808, "WEATHER"], [4522, 4532, "WEATHER"], [4543, 4556, "WEATHER"], [4795, 4805, "WEATHER"], [4998, 5005, "WEATHER"], [6021, 6031, "WEATHER"], [7075, 7085, "WEATHER"], [69, 74, "ALTITUDE"], [98, 101, "ABBREVIATION"], [707, 710, "CREW"], [1236, 1245, "AIRPLANE"], [1357, 1370, "CREW"], [1375, 1381, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1625, 1632, "ALTITUDE"], [2159, 2164, "ALTITUDE"], [2202, 2213, "ALTITUDE"], [2238, 2245, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2254, 2259, "ALTITUDE"], [2453, 2455, "ABBREVIATION"], [2648, 2652, "AIRPLANE"], [2684, 2688, "AIRPLANE"], [2770, 2775, "AIRPLANE"], [2804, 2808, "AIRPLANE"], [2886, 2890, "AIRPLANE"], [3082, 3087, "AIRPLANE"], [3257, 3260, "ABBREVIATION"], [3376, 3384, "CREW"], [3546, 3557, "CREW"], [3813, 3816, "ABBREVIATION"], [3939, 3945, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4115, 4119, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4241, 4254, "CREW"], [4289, 4292, "CREW"], [4330, 4335, "ALTITUDE"], [4347, 4360, "CREW"], [4379, 4386, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4495, 4500, "ALTITUDE"], [4558, 4563, "ALTITUDE"], [4601, 4606, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4615, 4620, "ALTITUDE"], [4740, 4742, "ABBREVIATION"], [5087, 5100, "CREW"], [5358, 5362, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5373, 5381, "CREW"], [5409, 5420, "CREW"], [5634, 5638, "AIRPLANE"], [6041, 6047, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6052, 6058, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6082, 6085, "CREW"], [6103, 6107, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6186, 6190, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6236, 6240, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6298, 6302, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6367, 6371, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6451, 6455, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6501, 6510, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6550, 6554, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6573, 6580, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6624, 6628, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6697, 6701, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6740, 6744, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6804, 6808, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6856, 6861, "CREW"], [6952, 6956, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6957, 6962, "CREW"]]}],

	["Ground cleared us to taxi to Runway 08R after crossing Runway 13 via L; hold short L. As we taxied to 08R via L; there was Aircraft Y holding short of 08R at L4. The Captain (CA) pulled in behind the Aircraft Y as it was taxing onto Runway 08R. I told the CA we were cleared to L; but this was my first time to this runway; and he said they usually want us at L4. I contacted ground to verify. Ground stated they cleared us to L not L4; but if we were able to depart L4; we could depart 08R at L4. The CA said yes we can take the L4 as the full length runway was 11;500 feet and L4 would not be an issue.The main contributing factor was the Aircraft Y holding short of L4 of 08R in which we pulled in behind. This was night time; and the signage could be brighter for taxing to L; as you must veer to the right; and loop around back to Runway 08R. The crew was given clearance to depart 08R at L4 by Ground Control prior to taxing onto the runway.L4 at 08R is well lit at night and very wide with lots of room. During night operations; crews should incorporate the possibility of pulling up to L4; and not L due to the size of the taxiway. The lesson I learned was to always contact Ground to confirm; should any confusion arise with where they cleared you to taxi to.\nWe received taxi instructions to taxi to Runway 8R via Taxiway L after crossing another runway. We were at the Taxiway L/L4 intersection and due to poor lighting and nighttime conditions it was difficult to determine our location at that time. We taxied past the taxiway directional sign array and there was no ground-based location marking for Taxiway L4. At this intersection for L4 and L; L4 leads to the threshold markings. Because we were unfamiliar with this area; we presumed that we were staying on L when in fact we turned on to L4. We held short of 8R and we were advised by Tower that we turned on to wrong taxiway. There was no incursion or safety hazard.Contributing factors to this situation were: Poor lighting; unfamiliarity with this area of the airport. Nighttime conditions; new crew; possible inadequate airport marking.In order to prevent a situation like this from happening again we will better identify threats such as unfamiliarity and environmental factors that may lead to confusion during ground operations. Additionally; the airport markings at this intersection and or environment could be improved to help pilots new to this airport navigate well on the ground.

	["On Day 2 of a 3 Day Trip; we experienced an irregular operation on our second leg; flight ZZZ-ZZZ1. The weather in ZZZ1 had deteriorated to sub-CAT 1; with low ceiling; low visibility and reports of moderate icing in the ZZZ1 terminal area. We prepared for an autoland approach to Runway XX. While established on the localizer just outside of the FAF; the preceding traffic reported that they had encountered severe icing on the same approach. We executed an early Missed Approach; climbed above the layers of icing conditions and requested delay vectors to evaluate our situation. After conferring with Dispatch via SatComm; it was jointly decided to return to ZZZ. We blocked-in to ZZZ at XA:58.Immediately following the completion of the Shutdown Checklist; I called our Dispatcher who said that based on several current PIREPS; icing conditions on the approach into ZZZ1 had improved from severe to moderate; and that we would be dispatched once again to ZZZ1 (we had received an ACARS message to this effect during our descent into ZZZ).However; as soon the L1 door opened (and while I was on the phone with Dispatch); the Customer Service Representative apparently announced that our flight had been cancelled. Passengers started to deplane... I relayed the information to our Dispatcher who confirmed that we would be flying back to ZZZ1. I made a PA to this effect; apologized for the confusion; jumped out of my seat and tried to inform those that had already made it to the jetway that we would be departing back for ZZZ1 once refueled.As has been my experience with past diversions; a few problems seem to reoccur: the flight paperwork cannot be retrieved; and the load manifest can take a long time to reconcile. This 'splash and go' took precisely 1h30min to accomplish!We finally blocked out at XC:28... While taxiing out at a slow speed (less than 10 kts.); I had to do an EMERGENCY STOP to avoid an airport operations vehicle driving at an estimated 40-50 mph southbound; outside of the vehicle road; rotating beacon flashing and headed right for us. Close call and narrowly avoided collision there! This vehicle had not seen us; made an emergency stop followed by a 180deg turn and stopped.Our flight to ZZZ1 was uneventful and concluded with an autoland on Runway XY. We blocked in at XD:37. Thanks to the ZZZ1 station contacting our hotel; transportation arrived promptly. I went to bed at XF:00.Our morning Report Time was adjusted to XN:52 for our departure to ZZZ. We got de-iced (it was snowing) and flew back to ZZZ.Upon arrival after an uneventful flight; my F/O and I had a discussion about fatigue. We had both slept about 5 hours; had woken up and tried to sleep more... We decided that it was not smart to continue our day as planned: a flight to ZZZ2; close to 3hrs of ground time; and then ZZZ2-ZZZ3.Our fatigue call was the result of an unforeseen irregular operation and didn't have much to do with pairing construction.

	["Operating flight from ZZZ-ZZZ1; pushed about 5 mins early. I was the PF (Pilot Flying); for the leg. During the push we started E1 first normal start. Then; we taxied out to Runway XXL at DD; it was a long taxi from the North Port. Once in line on N for departure started E2 with no problems; set hydraulics and shutdown the APU. Received a Line Up and Wait clearance with an advisory about a helicopter operating 2 south of the field; we taxied onto the runway and completed the Before Start Checklist. Once on the runway; controls we transferred to me. We received our take off clearance to fly runway heading and stay with the tower. Takeoff roll everything was normal; and the departure was normal. Tower gave us two vectors; 180 and 220 respectively; presumably around the helicopter traffic. Then switched us to departure. CA (Captain) Pilot Monitoring (PM) checked in with departure; who didn't give us higher initially; So we were leveling at 5000 ft. Once level; departure gave us a climb to 15;000 ft.; which we read back and started climbing. About 5500 ft.; during the climb there was a loud bang from the left side of the aircraft; immediately the E1 started to roll back; with a Amber E1 Fail message on the EICAS. CA (PM) identified and cancelled; and began running the QRH; at the same time departure had cleared us direct to ZZZZZ. The CA [Requested Priority Handling] and advised we would need vectors to return to ZZZ. Departure assigned a 280 heading and maintain 6000 ft.; which I complied with and set into the FGP and turned off the autothrottles. The CA continued to run the QRH; we attempted the auto relight procedure which did not happen. There was no oil pressure; but full quantity. So the engine was secured using the QRH. We then established with approach that we would return to ZZZ; they told us to expect Runway XXC. Approach gave a few different westerly vectors to give us time to run the QRH; and get set up for the approach. The CA attempted to talk to the FAs (Flight Attendant) using the EMER call button; after they picked up he was unable to hear himself or them or me with his headset (no idea why). I could hear him and the FAs just fine; so I talked with the FAs told them we had an engine failure; we would be returning to ZZZ in about 10-15 minutes; there would be no need for brace. He was finally able to get back on the headset; and hear normally. He continued to notify and sent an ACARS message to Dispatch to advise our return and made a PA to the passengers. The CA continued the QRH; and setup the Runway XXC approach. We considered the Runway XXC approach briefed as we had just done the approach on leg 1 of that day into ZZZ. We advised approach we were ready for the approach and vectors were given onto the approach; we were over KARR in the turn. The CA followed up with the FAs on the normal call button; and was able to talk with them and make sure everything/everyone was safe and ready. They advised the cabin was secured and ready. We continued on the approach; and they wanted us maintain 210 till ZZZZZ1; and then 170 till ZZZZZ2. I slowed a little before ZZZZ2; during configuration so we were configured and stable a little before the FAF. Which meant we were slower than 170 before ZZZZZ2 (probably 155 or so). We followed the ILS glideslope and localizer in and landed on Runway XXC. Tower advised us to expected a right turn off after landing and the [airport rescue and fire fighting] would inspect. We turned right on F and left on RR and stopped had [airport rescue and fire fighting] inspect the left engine for signs of damage. They reported no visible damage; fire; or leaking fluids. We then advised ground that we were ready to taxi to the gate; and taxied to the gate and parked without incident. Passengers deplaned; and I completed the post flight inspection; did not note any other damage to the aircraft or damage on the external of the engine.

	["Aircraft X was the only aircraft being worked.  Just before or during the briefing the pilot had expressed concern about radar vectors to the ILS Z Runway 12 approach that they would be too short for his autopilot to take.  It struck me as strange because he was still on the downwind with approximately 15-20 miles to fly before base turn.  The pilot requested to start the approach from EMIBE; an IAF; which was behind him.  The Supervisor issued a vector 020 and told the aircraft to expect direct EMIBE once the intercept was less than 90 degrees.  I took the position; and was evaluating whether 020 would be enough of a turn.  Then the Supervisor keyed up the briefing button and briefed me on OSR (CIC) position.  I turned Aircraft X to H050; thinking the turn back to EMIBE from the 020 would be too tight.  By this point the aircraft had increased speed 50-60 kts.  I called ZLC Sector 19 with a point out since I knew he would be close to the airpsace boundary turning to EMIBE and cleared Aircraft X direct EMIBE; cross EMIBE at 10;000; cleared ILS Z Runway 12 approach.   The Supervisor and I watched as the aircraft got close to a 11;000 MVA; but it was obvious the aircraft would turn inside of it; and the Supervisor made a comment to that fact.  At this point the Supervisor left since their position overlap was complete.  After EMIBE; the pilot flew direct NEGOE instead of flying the DME arc on the approach.  I advised him of the course deviation; and said I could vector him outside of NEGOE or back to EMIBE; and he opted for vectors to final outside of NEGOE.  I cancelled their approach clearance and vectored them to final.  On their base to final turn Aircraft X gained approximately 80 kts of ground speed; and went through final; I gave them vectors to join from the other side.After getting off position I wanted to review the falcon replay because the aircraft got closer to the 11;000 MVA than I expected; and I wanted to review the situation.  During this time; I realized I had an error and the aircraft had entered a 10;600 MVA at 10;000; and flew in that MVA for several miles.  This happened before the aircraft neared the 110 MVA.  For some reason I did not consider that MVA; or recognize that Aircraft X would or had lost separation with terrain there.I recall at the time feeling that something [wasn't] right; but I attributed it to the pilot's request and concern about vectors to final.  It is unusual to vector an aircraft to EMIBE; and I may have cleared 5 or so aircraft at EMIBE in the last year.  The MVA immediately south of the 10;600 MVA is 8;000 feet; and immediately west is 8;600 feet.  The MVA map shows 10;600 at the far north of the map and far northeast; and I think I overlooked it as being part of the 8;600 MVA.  I distinctly remembered thinking he would be fine at 10;000 when I took the position; and my only concern was for the 11;000 MVA at the time.I would like to recommend that the MVA map (Fusion 3 mile map) be updated to add a 106 note just below the 110 MVA; which is at the southwest corner of the 106 MVA (the maps are abbreviated altitudes).  Most MVA altitudes on the map are near where the aircraft are being vectored; and I understand they are sparse to reduce clutter.  However; I think that might have helped me avoid this loss.Since learning of this error; I have spent some time looking at the terrain in detail (including google maps terrain); and realizing how close this aircraft was to terrain; and it has shocked me.  I wondered if the pilot was receiving any terrain warnings; but did not say anything.

	["The Captain and I were flying back to ZZZ. We were initially assigned the ZZZZZ arrival and loaded this up for the approach. It was visual conditions but the ATIS indicated gusty crosswinds landing RWY26R of 340/20-24 kts.; a strong North-westerly with lots of updraft and downdraft turbulence. While tracking to ZZZZZ1 the STAR was changed to ZZZZZ2 Arrival with direct tracking to ZZZZZ3. We were already FL230 and 280 kts. in cruise and despite low initial workload we failed to properly brief up and prepare for the approach. I did not realize that I had not properly tuned up 26R ILS [frequency]. I had the course correctly set but the frequency was apparently on something else. I began my descent as per the ZZZZZ2 meeting the altitude and speed restrictions however the plane began to get high after ZZZZZ4 and it required a higher rate of descent to meet the ZZZZZ2 waypoint altitudes of 13000 to 16000. I elected to use the speed brakes and increase rate of descent. The plane misbehaved and began to pitch up rather than hold its attitude and slow. I pressed the TCS button and forcibly had to hold the yoke forward in the descending attitude; but it wanted to fight against me badly out of trim confusing me. I had one hand on the yoke while the other adjusted the VS to where I wanted it. This caused some slightly jerky movements which I felt would be unpleasant for passengers. The Captain did not intervene but rather allowed me to continue with what I was doing. I felt I was struggling with the pitching tendency of the airplane in a phase of flight where I was trying to regain profile for the STAR without busting speed or altitude. This happened at least a couple of times between ZZZZZ4 and ZZZZZ5 while I tried to get back with the STAR profile as I was 2.5 dots high on the VPI. Things seemed to stabilize by the time I was approaching ZZZZZ6 and we made the turn for ZZZZZ7 trying to slow to 210 kts. but at about 9000. ATC then gave an instruction to slow to 190 kts. and descend to 5000 (from memory) and subsequently to 3000. It was very difficult to slow and descend as I was getting rather ubrupt uplift from the convection and turbulence.Really we should have been allowed by ATC to slow first in level flight and THEN descend (because we were faced with a lot of convective uplift and the associated turbulence in the circuit area below 10;000). So with Flaps 9 and the boards open the plane was still increasing in speed back up to 213 kts. after initially slowing to about 203 kst. The Autopilot was pitching badly also and after giving consideration to what effect it would be having on the passengers I elected to disconnect the AP and hand fly. Unfortunately the plane was out of trim initially and the turbulence was making it hard to come onto the correct altitude. Before I had a chance to properly trim out and maintain level flight ATC gave me '[Callsign]; turn right HDG 180' which I did manually hand flying. The plane initially began to climb with the uplift and I had to forcibly nose the aircraft down to maintain 3000. It got up to I think 3200 and then was level at 3000. I was then assigned HDG 240 to intercept for Visual Approach RWY 26R but while on the base leg due to the turbulence and still hand flying I passed below 3000 to be around 240 ft. low. I recovered my altitude but my speed was now up to 205 kts. and I needed to reduce to 190 as originally assigned because of traffic ahead. They instructed 170 kts. and I again tried to slow but it was at this point that it was observed by me that the ILS frequency was not correct because I could see us heading through the RWY 26R centerline but the LOC was not moving. I instructed the CA (Captain) to quickly tune me up to right frequency while I fairly aggressively turned northwards to avoid drifting further south. ATC instructed me to '[Callsign] TURN RIGHT NOW' however I was already very positively doing this and the CA got the 26R ILS tuned up. We were south of the centerline for 26R but had not infringed 26L at the point of recovery. By the time the LOC was tuned up and presented I estimate I would have deviated probably one third-scale deflection left of course. The strong crosswind blowing me south (it was probably more northerly at 3000 than the 340 degrees it was at ground level); coupled with the turbulence; disconnected AP and wrong frequency; instruction of ATC to descend at a rate and speed in adverse ambient conditions all combined to cause the altitude and speed excursions but most significantly the drift south of the 26R centerline. I immediately re-engaged the AP when the right frequency was in my RMU. Even with the AP re-engaged and now in level rather than descending flight it was still a struggle to remain level and stable for configuring for the GP. ATC instructed 160 KT because we were closing on the traffic ahead which must have been on a slow approach speed. I commanded Flaps 18 and then approaching GP capture Gear Down Flaps 22. As soon as it was possible I requested Flaps 45 Landing Check. It was again very difficult to fly the approach to 45 Flap speeds and not overspeed due to the gusty conditions. Likewise the plane wanted to get too slow and was getting uncomfortably low towards but not at the VREF speed. This required me putting in extra power to combat the sink and I was in the classic power - pitch battle that occurs in turbulence with over/under power applications outside a desirable 63% N1 benchmark to the point I was apparently between 75% and 45% N1 at times. This exacerbated the speed alterations which were rolling quickly in either direction due to the rapidly changing gusts and turbulence. It was very difficult to get stable and while battling hard like this I actually managed to get stable by the FAF but all the way to touchdown was challenging. I managed to reduce the range of thrust increase and decrease and pulled off a sound crosswind landing despite the rather tardy; over-controlled STAR and RWY approach that preceded it. The Flight Attendant later commented within earshot of passengers that 'You guys caused chaos back here' as a young boy onboard near the rear of the aircraft vomited apparently on touchdown. She further mentioned that she was 'In the brace position'. I think her remarks were unprofessional and over-dramatized the real situation. That stated I would definitely agree that the approach was certainly not the smooth; perfectly stable approach I intended nor my finest moment in aviation either. The turbulent conditions; ATC instructions; my error in setting up the RMU frequency; the autopilot disconnecting; etc. as explained above were the prime contributors. The lack of real assistance from the CA with my high workload when the STAR was getting high left me operating with an almost single-pilot IFR workload up to the point where the correct frequency was tuned up. I over-controlled and had the height excursions. That was my fault. The UAS that resulted first above and then below 3000 was a result of me struggling in difficult ambient conditions without the autopilot assistance because I judged that it was not helping me when in fact it probably was. I re-engaged it and kept it on until about 500 ft. This helped me but it still wanted to pitch up and down in an over-controlling manner itself like a bucking bronco. I had to provide control resistance to prevent undesired pitch changes either way depending on the sink or lift from the shear and turbulence that was present. It was just very difficult conditions and was made worse by being in the wrong configuration of Flaps 45 rather than 22 for the visual with ILS guidance. Definitely it was a blunder not having the right frequency in when it was to be relied upon for lateral and vertical guidance in support of the visual observance of the runway / glide path with the instruments (PAPI vs IVSI; ASI; FD; N1; etc).I think be prepared to use the autopilot and minimize control oscillations. Be prepared for changes in STAR or changes in RWY. Brief the approach better and make mention of the conditions and how I would be best assisted by the PNF (Pilot not Flying). A better plan; recognition of the threat would have helped me here but it has already helped me subsequently. This leg was the first one of me flying on Day 6. I may have had fatigue creeping in and like alcohol; you do not recognize your own performance deterioration until too late. Nevertheless; I had a following leg from ZZZ and with the same turbulent conditions and strong crosswind (but coming from the opposite side) whereby I was able to fly a much more normal approach having learned from the ZZZ experience the flight before. It would have been much better to fly the ZZZ approach and probably the ZZZ2 one also FLAP 22 rather than FLAP 45 as the aircraft was an LR. I did not think the crosswind would be such an issue (up to 14 kt.) but the real problem was the gustiness and the turbulence. That caused me to over-control somewhat on final after I had lost my scan efficacy badly on the base leg and had the associated height excursions first one way then the other. It was not pretty and it will stay with me for some time as I make very sure it is not repeated again.", {"entities": [[261, 268, "WEATHER"], [273, 282, "WEATHER"], [283, 293, "WEATHER"], [2143, 2153, "WEATHER"], [2158, 2168, "WEATHER"], [2332, 2342, "WEATHER"], [2740, 2750, "WEATHER"], [3227, 3237, "WEATHER"], [4327, 4337, "WEATHER"], [5394, 5404, "WEATHER"], [5664, 5674, "WEATHER"], [7472, 7477, "WEATHER"], [7482, 7492, "WEATHER"], [8954, 8964, "WEATHER"], [4, 11, "CREW"], [23, 29, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [115, 123, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [158, 162, "ABBREVIATION"], [218, 221, "ABBREVIATION"], [324, 328, "ABBREVIATION"], [407, 412, "ALTITUDE"], [421, 424, "ABBREVIATION"], [429, 435, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [520, 528, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [585, 588, "ABBREVIATION"], [696, 703, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [848, 855, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [968, 975, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1114, 1118, "AIRPLANE"], [1134, 1144, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1243, 1247, "AIRPLANE"], [1397, 1404, "CREW"], [1613, 1617, "ABBREVIATION"], [1755, 1759, "ABBREVIATION"], [1848, 1859, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1921, 1924, "ABBREVIATION"], [1945, 1948, "CREW"], [1989, 1992, "ABBREVIATION"], [1998, 2005, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2088, 2095, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2207, 2210, "CREW"], [2250, 2257, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2469, 2472, "ABBREVIATION"], [2874, 2877, "CREW"], [2910, 2913, "ABBREVIATION"], [2982, 2987, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3026, 3030, "AIRPLANE"], [3141, 3144, "ABBREVIATION"], [3173, 3181, "CREW"], [3182, 3185, "ABBREVIATION"], [3207, 3215, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3253, 3259, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3293, 3299, "ALTITUDE"], [3361, 3364, "ABBREVIATION"], [3465, 3468, "ABBREVIATION"], [3557, 3560, "ABBREVIATION"], [3630, 3633, "ABBREVIATION"], [3638, 3648, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3657, 3660, "ABBREVIATION"], [3694, 3696, "ABBREVIATION"], [3698, 3705, "CREW"], [3827, 3830, "CREW"], [3933, 3935, "ABBREVIATION"], [3948, 3951, "ABBREVIATION"], [3983, 3993, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4070, 4073, "ABBREVIATION"], [4197, 4206, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4391, 4394, "CREW"], [4398, 4405, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4562, 4572, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4703, 4713, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4800, 4803, "CREW"], [4898, 4906, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4944, 4955, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5081, 5084, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5089, 5097, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5809, 5818, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5921, 5930, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5981, 5985, "ABBREVIATION"], [5990, 5993, "ABBREVIATION"], [5994, 6002, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6201, 6210, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6398, 6406, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6454, 6462, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6541, 6544, "CREW"], [6605, 6614, "AIRPLANE"], [6720, 6722, "ABBREVIATION"], [6754, 6758, "ABBREVIATION"], [6816, 6821, "CREW"], [6822, 6825, "ABBREVIATION"], [7089, 7098, "AIRPLANE"], [7227, 7233, "ALTITUDE"], [7651, 7654, "ABBREVIATION"], [7834, 7840, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [7890, 7893, "ABBREVIATION"], [7939, 7948, "AIRPLANE"], [8011, 8015, "ABBREVIATION"], [8030, 8033, "ABBREVIATION"], [8045, 8053, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8151, 8157, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8303, 8309, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8540, 8549, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8608, 8611, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8631, 8639, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8732, 8735, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8744, 8752, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8859, 8868, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [9062, 9070, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["I was scheduled to fly aircraft from ZZZ-ZZZ1. Upon pulling the paperwork in [our EFBs]; we saw 4 MELs [21-XX (both packs); 31-XX; and 21-XX; I believe). As we arrived to the aircraft to begin pre-flighting; we saw all of the MEL stickers and lots of lights illuminated. At some point we noticed that the Right PACK light was not extinguishing after the MASTER CAUTION reset was performed. When we selected the temperature display; we saw the right pack temp was 80 degrees C and climbing. So we turned off the right pack. This seemed odd so the CA (Captain) called maintenance control who told us that this was normal as the RAM air valves were slightly closed and the pack wasn't getting any airflow since were on the ground. Except the left pack had the same write ups and was indicating about 12 degrees C. The CA called [Flight Operations and Dispatch] and relayed our situation (meanwhile we're completely boarded and awaiting close out/pushback at this time). [Flight Operations and Dispatch] initially seemed to think the PACK light was related to our multiple MEL situation; until we realized and thus pointed out; that for all the current MELs; the PACK lights may illuminate upon MASTER CAUTION recall; but should then both extinguish after MASTER CAUTION reset. Around this time we realized if we didn't have all these MELs and showed up to a jet with a PACK light illuminated and pack temp exceeding 80 degrees C; we would write it up; so that's what we ended up doing. The mechanic came out to work on the aircraft while crew scheduling called to ask if we'd accept a duty day extension as our show time was XA:30 acclimated and we weren't going to make our original arrival time.

	["At the gate in ZZZ I reviewed the AML and took note of the MELs and NEFs listed in the MIC Sheet and inside cover. During cockpit preflight setup I noted that the AFT temp controller was placed to the OFF position. This coincided with one of the MELs listed which was derived from an earlier writeup of higher temp in a portion of the aft zone of the cabin. We had not yet started the APU so the packs were not yet on. As we proceeded well into the passenger boarding; when ground personnel asked to disconnect PCA and electric; the Captain started the APU and told them to stand by to disconnect. It was at some point after we established the packs just before entry door was closed; I think the Purser first made mention of the lack of air in a section of the aft cabin. I remember noting that the AFT temp at this check being at 77 and so I adjusted the FWD lower to try to accommodate. The push back and taxi out was a little longer than usual. Once airborne we climbed up to altitude with little delay and no problems in our climb to FL360. I was Pilot Flying; but I included a scan of AC panel and responsibility of temperature control throughout; monitoring the temps as we cruised. They showed a little higher than ideal but never drastic. While in route through ZZZ2 airspace well past DALUD; the purser again called up to say how uncomfortable it was in this one section of the AFT cabin. I remember looking up at the AC panel temps and seeing all zones in the 70's. The CA concluded that we turn off the Right recirc fan which I reached up and did. Some moments after Captain reached over to the AC panel overhead and turned off the Left Recirc fan. We discussed the consequences of this action and consulted the manual to find a reference to get clarity on this new configuration. It was shortly thereafter that we got aural warning and Cabin Altitude light. The CA was well ahead of me in the donning of his mask so as Pilot Flying; I stayed with the instruments to fly the aircraft. As he got established on oxygen I alerted transfer of controls with 'Your aircraft' to which he responded and I commenced donning of my mask. While doing so I heard Captain command to get lower altitude. I keyed the mic to ATC and asked for; '...as low as we can get'. To which they replied descend to FL260. Pilot Flying adjusted the MCP I concurred and looked up to see the cabin altitude at about 11;000 ft. and the rate climbing. Captain called for QRC and as I was Pilot Monitoring; it was started as we started down. The Captain said we need to go further lower. ZZZ1 ATC was either talking to us or another aircraft at this time; I am not sure. But to get the attention for altitude needed I called [for priority handling] and told them we were going to descend to 10;000 ft. They then acknowledged our requests thereafter.While the Pilot Flying conducted the descent I made my way through the QRC. At the step of checking controllability of the cabin altitude I looked up to see the cabin still above 11;000 ft. and the rate was now higher than the previous check. The Captain reached for the Passenger Oxygen switch and pushed it. The rest of the QRC was completed to the end and I then elected out of habit to resort to the paper QRH. At some point in this descent the Captain decided to insert a divert to ZZZ2 in Rte2 while we descended straight ahead delaying the turn to divert while executing the descent. We were in visual conditions throughout the descent and it was clear that terrain was not to be a factor north and west of our position.At reaching 10;000 ft. we transferred control of the aircraft more than a couple of time as he communicated with the cabin; crew and passengers. There was ample time to complete all items of the checklist in preparation for an overweight landing at ZZZ1. Wind was 5 kts from the NNE so we landed flaps 30 on Runway 3. No autobrakes as per checklist and a sink rate less than 300fpm.It took about 1 hour 40 mins for the entire process of awaiting personnel and permission from the airport to finally allow us to deplane at a jetbridge. Initially were sent to a hard stand at position 14. We were lucky to have had access to a PCA during this lengthy wait to keep the cabin comfortable. The Captain opted to restart the right engine as we were towed over to the terminal to provide the backup power and air if needed.Later it was revealed that there was a leak in a conditioned air tube. This would not only explain the Hot zone but the depleted flow of air into the cabin.

The student and the instructor (myself) were instructed to report the airport in sight about 7 miles southwest from ERGEY on vectors to intercept the RNAV 35. About 4.5 miles from ERGEY the student tried to call Fort Worth Center three times all the way to ERGEY without any response from Approach. (Approach was busy on arrival). As the instructor I changed radios to make sure the Controller could hear us and tried to call Approach (at this time we are already intercepting the RNAV 35 approach).

During the switch over I got an alert on my iPad from my Scout ADS-B portable letting me know traffic at 12 o'clock 2 miles same altitude. The student was in the middle of calling Tower. During the Tower's response to let me know I have traffic ahead I had taken controls from the student and turned left to avoid the aircraft I had spotted after the alert. I was roughly 400 ft. or less from the aircraft; enough to see the tail number and pilot clearly as I rolled out on a northerly heading off of the RNAV approach path. After landing I went to [the] Tower and talked to the Controllers to make sense of why the aircraft was heading the opposite direction and same altitude when I was cleared for an IFR approach on an IFR flight plan. The response from the Tower personnel was that the other aircraft was already on with approach with flight following. Tower Manager had called approach to ask to look into the matter.Some contributing factors: 1. Controller was obviously overwhelmed with calls entire time on frequency.2.

I noticed MKE Approach had Aircraft X about 5 miles in front of Aircraft Z. I called MKE to have them slow Aircraft X so I could a sequence started. I descended Aircraft Z into MKE airspace about 3 miles before their boundary with mine. MSN called and I took the airspace. They had Aircraft Y on final and the pilot was told to cancel on frequency with Center. In the meantime I vectored Aircraft X on a 360 then a 180 heading to build space between him and Aircraft Z. Aircraft Z was approaching the final approach course and I still hadn't received a cancellation from Aircraft Y. I reached out to Aircraft X to attempt Aircraft Y on company frequency and then I called the OMIC desk. He inadvertently hung up on me the first time. He called back and I passed the information. He asked a question and paused. I wasn't sure if he hung up again or what happened so I became distracted by this and didn't watch Aircraft X close enough. He clipped a portion of MKE approach and RFD Approach without any coordination. Aircraft X did not come near any other aircraft; it just entered the adjoining airspace. Aircraft Y finally called and cancelled and I was able to get Aircraft Z and Aircraft X into MSN. A few minutes later...The MVA just west of the final approach course for Runway 36 at MSN is 036. Aircraft A checked on inbound for MSN direct to PACOV. I had control from FARMM sector and RFD Approach. I'm certain I descended Aircraft A to 036. I turned the aircraft to a 270 heading to build space between JIA and SKW [2 weeks earlier Aircraft A had to go around twice while inbound to MSN and I didn't want it to happen again). I gave Aircraft A direct PACOV and moved my attention to the MSN arrivals I had next in line. When I got back to Aircraft A the aircraft was descending out of 032. The MVA in that area is 031. I asked Aircraft A to verify altitude and assigned altitude; it responded that it was just leveling off at 030. I issued a low altitude alert and climbed it 031. The pilot and myself questioned each other. He thought I issued 030; I thought I issued 036. I have not listened to the tapes so I'm not sure which is correct. There are always MSN arrivals that land right after MSN closes. Traffic has seemed to pick up in the last month or so though. 3 out of the last 4 mids I have had 8-10 aircraft scheduled to arrive at MSN within the same 15 minute span after they closed. MSN is a one-in; one-out airport once they close. I cannot clear another aircraft for approach until the previous has cancelled. This makes for a complex workload.

	["I take full responsibility for this error. When we left the gate I felt alert and ready to accomplish the last flight of the night. We had already been delayed due to ATC constraints and weather in DEN. In these weather conditions everything takes longer. Taxiways were slippery so we had to taxi slowly. Deice took some time and the frequencies were congested; so afterward Ramp took our flight number and promptly forgot about us leading to us being three aircraft behind where we should have taxied out. This isn't a factor but was frustrating. We taxied to 16L and took off after almost an hour from push. We took off in LNAV and VNAV putting FL230 in the window instead of 10;000'; which we would have put in previously for the hold down. I mentally noted the 10;000' level off. Shortly after takeoff in snow; low visibility and high traffic conditions; we hit wake turbulence. It wasn't super significant but it was enough that I was thinking about it beyond its finish and I shouldn't have. I opted to hand fly (biggest mistake). As we reached 10;000'; I was hand flying and following the command bars; we got a TCAS TA and I slowed the climb still remaining on or just below the command bars with LNAV/VNAV and autothrottles on; but hand flying. I looked at my altitude and saw 10;300' and finally remembered that we had a hold-down. I returned to 10;000' while simultaneously hearing ATC ask about our altitude and then giving us a number to call. I have not had an altitude deviation in my career previously. The main factor that could have prevented this was using the appropriate level of automation. After the wake turbulence encounter I should have turned on the autopilot and managed the automation freeing my attention to reference the SID and remember the 10000 ft hold down.

	["VNAV/Autopilot uses aggressive pitch changes to chase the VNAV profile and disregards airspeed target at top of descent.  Aircraft would overspeed if not for pilot intervention.  This occurs at (nearly) EVERY top of descent on seemingly EVERY flight.  In this case; we had a strong jet-stream tailwind component.  Descent winds were programmed and accurate.This is not a one-time event.  Every pilot experiences this and everyone complains about it.  We need to use speed brakes for drag at nearly every top of descent.  We often need to kick off the autopilot and/or switch to 'CWS' for a smoother transition - while pulling back to induce drag; break the rate of descent and reduce indicated airspeed/Mach.  This poor-quality system causes distraction(s) and increases workload.  It creates a poor quality 'ride' hence is bad for customer experience and provides substandard hospitality.  This is a hazard to flight attendant safety.  This all occurs nearly simultaneously with the increased workload associated with changing altitudes; ATC radio handoffs and traffic callouts/TCAS events.  More often than not; the auto-throttles simultaneously kick in and advance during steep descent; necessitating further pilot intervention to override this obvious unnecessary and distracting action. Sometimes; the FMC scratch-pad message 'drag required' will present itself - even as the autothrottles are advancing and the autopilot is dropping the nose!This cycle repeats itself as the aircraft transitions altitudes and experiences changing atmospherics; most obviously changing wind speed and/or direction.  The bewilderment at the automation is a regular passenger in the cockpit.In summary; 'what (the xxxx) is it doing?' is not just a statement of startled bewilderment; it is evidence of a gross failure of the VNAV/autopilot/auto-throttle system.  Preventive Measures: ['Use ALT INTV or descend now and begin an early; hopefully smooth interception of the descent profile.  Reprogram the VNAV.  Hire better engineers.  Update the FMC database.  Perform a systems analysis to discover the fault(s).  Redesign the Speed-Pitch-Autothrottle (VNAV/Auto-Pilot/Auto-throttle) System for better functionality.  Can we increase the size of the descent wind database? Teach the auto-throttles to be more aggressive and retard in anticipation of a nose down with increasing airspeed.  Introduce anticipation circuitry into the control system.  Can we get a little A.I. and put some learning-software on the jets? Analyze speed brake utilization data to get factual data of wasted fuel (cost impact).  Compare to other/better automation.  Improve descent atmospheric database.

	["Our flight was scheduled for approximately six and a half hours from ZZZZ-ZZZZ1. It's been this way for years in fact. And today was indeed a two man crew.

Now we have an entirely different routing over a different region which goes over Africa instead of traversing from Asia to Europe. So we were scheduled six and a half hours and showed up for an eight a half hour flight; which we didn't realize or expect. We called to confer with with the chief pilot; and the company directed us to go. The company said we were legal because of flight history and 121.471 allows for airspace closure. This is contrary from what I understood. FAR 121 allows a flight normally and reasonably at eight hours to depart if local; daily circumstances have varied to increase flight time over eight hours. This would allow for things like strong winds; significant convective weather; or a TFR Temporary Flight Restriction. None were the case here.   In this case; historical data also wouldn't be relevant since this new routing is over another region-continent; not just a different airway. Furthermore; this particular flight was also VMC with no delays. In fact we also had three ATC shortcuts. And we had a visual approach. The flight was 8:37.

On our departure climb out someplace around 8000 ft. we had a LEFT BLEED TRIP OFF Caution indicating a LEFT BLEED Overheat/Overpressure condition.We ran the BLEED TRIP OFF Caution QRH checklist and the BLEED TRIP OFF light extinguished which was considered reset and the end of the procedure. After some time as we continued our climb the LEFT BLEED TRIP OFF Caution light appeared again for the 2nd time.This time as we were re-running the QRH checklist for the 2nd time the BLEED TRIP OFF indication would not reset anymore and stayed illuminated confirming a BLEED Overheat/Overpressure condition. Shortly after we also received a CABIN ALTITUDE Aural Warning indication. We advised ATC; initiated a descent to 10;000 ft. and ran the QRC/QRH CABIN ALTITUDE Warning checklist.After completing the QRH checklist we assessed the situation and due to the multiple BLEED TRIP OFF Overheat/Overpressure indications coupled with the CABIN ALTITUDE Warning indication we decided to divert back to ZZZ for a normal landing. We safely made a normal landing; parked at the gate and handed [the] plane to the ZZZ maintenance team.", {"entities": [[65, 71, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [72, 80, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [84, 91, "ALTITUDE"], [160, 167, "ALTITUDE"], [169, 171, "ABBREVIATION"], [222, 225, "ABBREVIATION"], [343, 348, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [376, 381, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [558, 567, "ALTITUDE"], [733, 742, "AIRPLANE"], [820, 822, "ABBREVIATION"], [851, 858, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [867, 876, "ALTITUDE"], [986, 994, "ALTITUDE"], [1005, 1014, "ALTITUDE"], [1046, 1051, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1167, 1176, "ALTITUDE"], [1216, 1219, "ABBREVIATION"], [1283, 1292, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1429, 1438, "ALTITUDE"], [1648, 1659, "CREW"], [1678, 1683, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1705, 1712, "ALTITUDE"], [1841, 1844, "ABBREVIATION"], [1990, 1995, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2102, 2105, "ABBREVIATION"], [2347, 2350, "CREW"], [2364, 2371, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2375, 2384, "ALTITUDE"], [2402, 2405, "ABBREVIATION"], [2460, 2463, "ABBREVIATION"], [2712, 2718, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2726, 2730, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2765, 2776, "CREW"]]}],

With the help of the Chief Pilot and the Flight Department it was decided that this was the best way to ensure the safety of our employees and customers.

	["According to COM 1 3.1.62; we were clearly legal to initiate the flight.  Our confusion comes from what we should do if the crew oxygen drops below the minimum required crew oxygen psi with the in flight reference temperature calculation because it also talks about that the minimum bottle pressure is to compensate for preflight checks; normal crew use while a crewmember is away from his/her station; normal system leakage; and use during an abnormal/emergency situation.  This insinuates that there is an understanding that one can take off with the exact minimum O2 psi and lose some under normal system leakage and crew use while a crewmember is away from their station.  But to my knowledge; there isn't a procedure in place to determine what the critical level is to initiate a diversion.  I suggest that the company addresses this and creates a procedure that can give us better guidance in this kind of situation.  It's important to note that this situation ultimately began in ZZZ during preflight of XXXX for [flight] to ZZZ1 when I noticed that the crew oxygen pressure was roughly 870 psi.  I pointed out that the pressure was fairly low given the current reference temperature was calculated to be 25 degrees C; but we were still legal to dispatch for only 2 crew members and no jumpseaters per COM 1 3.1.62.  The decision was made to not notify maintenance and proceed to ZZZ1.  During cruise we received a message for the crew oxygen dropping below 800 psi.  COM 2 ECAM Advisory Conditions 3.80.25 list the parameters of what triggers this message and pointed us to AOM VOL 1 to make sure the oxygen masks are stowed correctly; which we determined they were.  We continued to ZZZ1.  The captain sent maintenance and dispatch ACARS messages requesting Maintenance to meet us in ZZZ1 and service the crew oxygen before our flight to ZZZ2.Once on the ground in ZZZ1; we were advised that oxygen was unavailable.  The captain had already written a discrepancy in the logbook requesting that Maintenance service the crew oxygen.  The crew oxygen was at 780 psi; and with a given reference temperature of 28 degrees C; we were still above the required amount of approximately 750 psi.  Maintenance opted to defer the cockpit jumpseat being that there was only enough crew oxygen for the Captain and First Officer and clear the discrepancy.  We received our amendment from Dispatch and initiated the flight to ZZZ2.  Once in cruise; the crew oxygen psi continued to drop.  At the rate the crew oxygen psi was dropping; I estimated we would land in ZZZ2 with approximately 600 psi.  We looked in COM 2 for a procedure that could help us determine when we should consider making a precautionary diversion; but no such procedure exists.  Instead; we determined that the flashing green crew oxygen psi on the DOOR ECAM page would turn amber at 400 psi according to COM 1 ECAM Advisory Conditions 3.80.25 and we would use that figure as our diversion point since we were now over land and had ample airports to divert to with acceptable facilities and weather.  We also determined that we had the greatest rate of crew oxygen psi loss at higher altitudes; so we had Dispatch send us new performance numbers for completing the rest of the flight at FL250.  During this time; we also asked dispatch for guidance from a Chief Pilot and Maintenance Control of how to arrest the dissipation of crew oxygen; and if a diversion was required for the current amount on board; approximately 670 psi.  Maintenance told us via ACARS that we could check the masks to see if they were at 100% O2 and turn off the crew oxygen system if not using it.  We opted to not turn the system off being that it is required to be on.  Once we received new numbers for the lower flight level; be descended to FL250 roughly 400 nautical miles from ZZZ2 which seemed to slow the dissipation of crew oxygen.  We landed uneventfully and arrived at the gate with 620 psi of crew oxygen remaining.", {"entities": [[214, 225, "WEATHER"], [290, 298, "WEATHER"], [1073, 1081, "WEATHER"], [1127, 1135, "WEATHER"], [1179, 1190, "WEATHER"], [2100, 2111, "WEATHER"], [3056, 3063, "WEATHER"], [181, 184, "ABBREVIATION"], [320, 329, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [535, 543, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [570, 573, "ABBREVIATION"], [998, 1007, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1098, 1101, "ABBREVIATION"], [1360, 1371, "CREW"], [1401, 1407, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1469, 1472, "ABBREVIATION"], [1481, 1485, "AIRPLANE"], [1703, 1710, "CREW"], [1716, 1727, "CREW"], [1741, 1746, "AIRPLANE"], [1767, 1778, "CREW"], [1930, 1937, "CREW"], [2003, 2014, "CREW"], [2068, 2071, "ABBREVIATION"], [2190, 2193, "ABBREVIATION"], [2196, 2207, "CREW"], [2227, 2234, "AIRPLANE"], [2297, 2304, "CREW"], [2309, 2322, "CREW"], [2382, 2390, "CREW"], [2434, 2440, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2458, 2461, "ABBREVIATION"], [2510, 2513, "ABBREVIATION"], [2549, 2553, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2585, 2588, "ABBREVIATION"], [2803, 2806, "ABBREVIATION"], [2819, 2823, "AIRPLANE"], [2853, 2856, "ABBREVIATION"], [2876, 2880, "AIRPLANE"], [2984, 2988, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3130, 3133, "ABBREVIATION"], [3170, 3178, "CREW"], [3252, 3257, "ALTITUDE"], [3337, 3348, "CREW"], [3489, 3492, "ABBREVIATION"], [3495, 3506, "CREW"], [3519, 3524, "AIRPLANE"], [3773, 3782, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3786, 3791, "ALTITUDE"], [3886, 3892, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3910, 3917, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3925, 3929, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3939, 3942, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

Shortly after that; we noticed that the quantity indication was decreasing; and stabilized at 20%. We recognized that as a leak in the pump itself; or possibly the lines to the pump; and considered that the primary cause for the failure. As such; and given that the electric pump was operational and no other system degradation was noticed; we continued to ZZZ. We monitored the hydraulic page; and noticed that the quantity was further decreasing; at a rate of 1% every ten to fifteen minutes. We calculated that we'd land with 8% to 10%.During this time (from occurrence to top of descent); we coordinated with Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The decision to continue was supported.

	["[I was] SIC inbound and on circle to land RWY XX at ZZZ from RNAV GPS RWY XY. While being cleared for the RNAV XY circle to land XX at ZZZ; the PIC flew through the final approach course due to her disarming the approach function in the Universal UNS-1 FMS. We were vectored back on course by ZZZ Approach Control. As we saw the runway and were descending to the initial approach altitude; ZZZ Approach Control cleared us for the visual to XX circle east; report canceling instruments with him or Tower. The PIC was preoccupied with many other extraneous matters and was voicing that. She began her descent to the circling altitude of 1;160 msl while I checked in with the Tower and canceled instruments. I recommended her to level off at the pattern altitude of 2;100 MSL; in order to have a much better view of the runway for the downwind circle. The ceiling and visibility were excellent. She disregarded my advice and continued her descent to the much lower circle altitude. When we arrived at the circle alt I was having difficulty keeping the runway in sight; the PIC had disengaged the A/P and was hand flying. Her heading was [20 degrees off from the] reciprocal of the landing runway and she was allowing the aircraft airspeed to slow down near Vref. I brought this to her attention several times and she would momentarily correct. As her situational awareness deteriorated; she told me to have the Tower call her base leg turn. I was struggling to keep the runway in sight at this low altitude and monitoring our airspeed and heading. She became preoccupied with what a poor impression she was presenting to our passengers; I told her to forget that and fly the aircraft. As a small single engine prop aircraft in the pattern with us was cleared to turn base and land; she became more anxious about ours and the runway location. I saw the aircraft turn base and told her she could begin her turn toward the runway; again her airspeed management became an issue. Her turn rate was becoming insufficient and I was more emphatic in my calls to her on turn rate and airspeed. At this point she became audibly irate with me and rolled out of her turn only to line up with Runway XZ instead of Runway XX. At this point the Tower; noticing the error; cleared her to land on RWY XZ. I asked her if that was her intention; at which she exclaimed RWY XZ was too short for us to land. I told the Tower we declined to land on RWY XZ because it was too short and the Tower told us to 'go around'. She did not execute our SOP missed approach procedure; I asked her if she was going to 'go around'; no answer. She simply flew the aircraft down the runway at the circling altitude. The Tower noticed this and asked our intentions. I said we would like to land on Runway XX; the Tower cleared us to turn left and enter the downwind for Runway XX. At this point I looked over in front of her and noticed the REILS and then the PAPI for RWY XX. I announced this to her; she apparently saw the runway and began here turn. I told the Tower we had the runway in sight. The Tower then cleared us to land. Even at this point in the approach sequence the PIC was complaining that she was going to look bad to the passengers.

	["During an instructional period with two primary students onboard and operating in the traffic pattern a pilot flying an instrument approach came dangerously close to our flight while executing the missed approach procedure. As I maneuvered my plane from Right Base to Final of Runway 12; the pilot of a Aircraft Y continued the ILS approach to Runway 26 without acknowledging us; who were already established in the traffic pattern. I made several radio calls on CTAF reporting our position and intentions of making a full-stop landing. The Aircraft Y pilot only made calls stating he is on the ILS approach and his distance to the airport starting at 8 miles and ending at 4 miles. As we touched down on Runway 12; I caught sight of the Aircraft Y at the approach end of Runway 26. I think I heard him call 'Missed Approach' but can't be 100% sure. I applied maximum braking to ensure we would not cross into Runway 26. As we came to a stop just short of the intersection of Runway 12 and 26; we saw the Aircraft Y fly overhead approximately 200 feet and appeared to be climbing. I immediately contacted the pilot on CTAF stating that we were established in the traffic pattern and had reported so. He replied that he had made position calls on final. I reiterated the fact that we were already established in the traffic pattern and implied that he should have avoided his direction of flight. Runway 26 intersects with Runway 12; 4;100 feet from the approach end. Runway 12 intersects Runway 26 approximately 1;800 feet from the approach end. It was obvious to me by his tone; that this pilot felt; just because he was making position reports at those distances; established himself in the traffic pattern and did not have to yield the right of way. It makes me wonder how close we would have been to each other if I had to make a go-around or was unable to stop by the Runway 26/12 intersection. I feel that if this pilot had made his intentions known; we could have worked together to complete our intended training and ensure safety of flight for both. It is my future intention; to query a pilot who is making vague radio calls and ask for specific intentions so that we can avoid or work together while in such proximity.

	["A frontal system had moved through ZJX airspace. Stretching from the Gulf of Mexico northeast all the way to North Carolina. The ride reports from the pilots had been negative all shift. There was a hole in the front near CTY VOR. All of the traffic going through the central area was going through that one hole. At one point the Controller at R17 reported severe turbulence from an aircraft at the flight level in the mid to high 30's. Right before this I was returning from break to relieve the OS (Operations Supervisor) on duty in the central. Once that report came though we both were helping to run the area. We informed the OMIC (Operations Manager In Charge); and he came down to monitor. He told us to keep getting pilot reports from aircraft that were also going through the same area of weather to see if the report was an isolated incident.After getting a few more reports; multiple aircraft had a difficult time maintaining altitude and there were multiple new reports of severe turbulence. Upon receiving the additional reports the OMIC decided to stop having aircraft go through that one hole in the weather. We told the sector north of the sector with all the severe turbulence reports to start pushing the aircraft east since there was a report of a new hold near the SAV VOR in the east area. We coordinated with ZTL to start routing aircraft through that hole and to not send aircraft south. The east area was given a heads up and the OS split the appropriate sectors off for the increased workload. After some time had passed the OS in the east area asked us to stop sending aircraft that way due to an additional 9 severe turbulence reports. At this time there was no safe way to traverse the front. It stretched too far north and too far south to go around it and there was no hole to attempt to get through it that didn't have multiple severe turbulence reports.A ground stop order was given to alleviate the complexity that the front had caused and to keep more aircraft from having to fly into it. The ground stop order was given too late and the volume that was already in the air was not helped at all by being driven into the weather. Later that night I was on the watch desk and the front had pushed through to the coast line. Aircraft in the ocean sectors in the north area were trapped on the east side of the front with multiple deviations and the workload and complexity were high. I called ZDC to ask when they think they might not be able to take any more aircraft since the weather would make them deviate further and further east. The ZDC Supervisor that I talked to on the phone said I needed to start rerouting aircraft into the HANRI sector going into ZNY which would let them go even further east and away from the front and bad rides. The controllers working the ocean sectors were far too busy to put in and give reroutes to every plane they had so I coordinated with TMU to shut down the AR traffic from ZMA unless they were going to ZNY HANRI sector. They put the request in and I was told it was denied by the command center.All of this started to happen roughly around XA:15 pm; but the front was a known even from that morning. There was no STMC and the whole plan was being run by a CIC in TMU. It seems as if when we get severe weather in ZJX we run until we can't and there is rarely a back up plan. When the weather gets too intense or the aircraft cannot deviate a certain way; whether its due to volume or more likely military airspace; the controllers are the ones caught in the middle trying to stay safe and get the aircraft where they need to go. In situations like this a ground stop worked for future aircraft but did not help the airborne volume and was not implemented in time. As of now there are no reports of injuries due to the severe turbulence that I'm aware of; but I feel like it would have been a different story if there was a report of severe turbulence and then an injury occurred on an aircraft after the initialreport. Our task is for the safe efficient and expeditious flow of traffic. It feels as if after days like this one safety can be negated for the expeditious. There was risked introduced into the NAS by not having a plan or even an idea of what to do with the airborne aircraft after the second hole had multiple severe turbulence reports. I worked as a supervisor and a controller on this shift and in both rolls I made sure that the option to hold was given to the aircraft instead of letting them keep on going through the front. It did not seem as if that option was given to the aircraft coming from the north. There was moderate chop reported all day and the rides deteriorated closer to the front. If you are too busy to put in all your moderate turbulence reports; which was told to me by some east area controllers; then you cannot pass along the information into the PIREP system to get other aircraft going through the stretch of airspace a fighting chance. The situation snowballs into what we ended up with; which was an unsafe event.The plan was not implemented early enough and nothing was really done to help the aircraft that were already airborne.", {"entities": [[211, 216, "WEATHER"], [365, 375, "WEATHER"], [799, 806, "WEATHER"], [993, 1003, "WEATHER"], [1116, 1123, "WEATHER"], [1184, 1194, "WEATHER"], [1644, 1654, "WEATHER"], [1715, 1720, "WEATHER"], [1867, 1877, "WEATHER"], [1953, 1958, "WEATHER"], [2155, 2162, "WEATHER"], [2213, 2218, "WEATHER"], [2342, 2347, "WEATHER"], [2511, 2518, "WEATHER"], [2757, 2762, "WEATHER"], [3135, 3140, "WEATHER"], [3279, 3286, "WEATHER"], [3361, 3368, "WEATHER"], [3802, 3812, "WEATHER"], [3917, 3927, "WEATHER"], [4308, 4318, "WEATHER"], [4514, 4519, "WEATHER"], [4686, 4691, "WEATHER"], [4741, 4751, "WEATHER"], [151, 157, "CREW"], [226, 229, "ABBREVIATION"], [331, 341, "CREW"], [725, 730, "CREW"], [1290, 1293, "ABBREVIATION"], [1770, 1779, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2011, 2014, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4865, 4870, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

The First Officer and I decided I would assume pilot flying duties due to the condition of the aircraft. I then started slowing the aircraft prior to return to burn more fuel off prior to landing. I also want to see how the aircraft performed slow. Once we slowed; the rudder pedal was 3/4 travel to the left with 5 units of left trim also. I then tried zeroing all the trim and aircraft rolled to the right. I then put all the trim back to get coordinated flight. I tried all 3 autopilots but they did not help. I then hand flew the aircraft for the approach and landing. We were cleared direct to [the] runway. We requested the emergency equipment standing by due to the overweight landing and our flight control issue. I turned final [and] I had the left rudder pedal 3/4 travel to the floor with 5 units of left rudder trim to maintain flight [and] the ball was also displaced. I asked the First Officer to feel the controls to see what we were dealing with. He was surprised of the amount of rudder needed to maintain somewhat coordinated flight. We slowed and went to flaps 30 and we did not have good control of the aircraft. I then went back to Flaps 25 for the landing which we had better control. I was concerned if had lost an engine in flight we would not have control of the aircraft with the amount of rudder that was displaced. We landed at 218;000 pounds at a speed of 150 kts; rate of descent was nil at touchdown. In the flare the control column abruptly oscillated back and forth violently - all I could do was to try and dampen the movement. We landed without incident. Taxied to a hard stand and deplaned. Cause: Flight Control issue with the rudder and elevator.\nInitially I was pilot flying. Upon takeoff the rudder pedals felt abnormal and it was harder than usual to maintain the runway centerline. At the time I assumed it was due to gusty crosswinds. After takeoff in climb the Captain mentioned to me that my yoke was skewed to the side by quite a bit. We adjusted the rudder trim to 5-6 units before the yoke leveled. As we climbed the required rudder trim reduced as we climbed; but it became apparent that something was not right with the flight controls. We attempted to communicate with dispatch; but that proved difficult as dispatch could not hear us on Crewphone app; ARINC frequencies did not work; and OPS could not do a phone patch. We were essentially on our own other than cumbersome communication through ACARS. We came to the conclusion that the safest course of action would be to return rather than continue over mountainous terrain for the 4 hours remaining in flight with an unknown flight control issue. We notified Dispatch via ACARS; and turned back. The Captain took over pilot flying duties for the landing. Upon descent; the rudder issues got worse and worse the slower we flew. We configured early to be well aware of any other control issues before we got close to the ground. The Captain stated that he had significant rudder inputs in order to hold heading. Just prior to touchdown the yoke swung forward and aft uncontrollably. We landed overweight with a minimal descent rate and on speed. Taxi to the gate was normal. There was an issue with the flight controls. It was not apparent until we were airborne. Lack of ability to communicate with the company and Maintenance over [region] was a contributing factor. We had to figure it out on our own with minimal input available from Maintenance or Dispatch. Improve our ability to communicate while airborne over remote areas.", {"entities": [[4, 17, "CREW"], [32, 39, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [91, 101, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [163, 170, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [215, 224, "AIRPLANE"], [258, 265, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [313, 322, "AIRPLANE"], [339, 344, "AIRPLANE"], [376, 383, "AIRPLANE"], [485, 490, "AIRPLANE"], [529, 542, "AIRPLANE"], [594, 601, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [605, 616, "ALTITUDE"], [709, 722, "AIRPLANE"], [777, 785, "CREW"], [884, 892, "CREW"], [918, 926, "CREW"], [1069, 1074, "AIRPLANE"], [1107, 1115, "CREW"], [1162, 1166, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1347, 1350, "CREW"], [1438, 1455, "CREW"], [1471, 1476, "AIRPLANE"], [1605, 1612, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1725, 1742, "CREW"], [1795, 1799, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1831, 1844, "CREW"], [1874, 1879, "CREW"], [2352, 2356, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2378, 2386, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2432, 2438, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2721, 2734, "CREW"], [3065, 3071, "AIRPLANE"], [3173, 3179, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3216, 3219, "ABBREVIATION"], [3229, 3236, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3248, 3257, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3392, 3398, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3417, 3423, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3434, 3439, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3502, 3510, "AIRPLANE"], [3528, 3533, "CREW"], [3534, 3540, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3547, 3554, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3559, 3572, "AIRPLANE"], [3632, 3638, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3639, 3649, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3711, 3718, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3722, 3727, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3732, 3739, "CREW"], [3764, 3768, "AIRPLANE"], [3860, 3864, "AIRPLANE"], [3880, 3887, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3927, 3934, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4274, 4279, "AIRPLANE"], [4491, 4499, "CREW"], [4504, 4509, "AIRPLANE"], [4532, 4539, "CREW"], [4550, 4555, "CREW"], [4592, 4599, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4653, 4657, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4763, 4770, "CREW"], [4856, 4865, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4870, 4874, "AIRPLANE"], [4916, 4922, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4949, 4956, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4988, 4992, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5146, 5157, "CREW"], [5268, 5279, "CREW"], [5283, 5291, "CREW"]]}],
	["Upon climb out; we experienced a series of events which led to a left engine failure. The First Officer and I decided that while we were running checklists; briefing the Flight Attendant and passengers; and talking to Dispatch and ATC; that we would head toward our intended destination and be set up on final approach by the time we were finished. At the end of the QRH procedures; it says to land at the nearest suitable airport; which at the time of the event would have been a closer airport. However my thought was that by the time we would've held; completed all of our tasks and descended; we would've already been just as close to our destination anyway; which has better services for our situation. I decided that it would not adversely affect the safety of flight and elected to continue to our destination.The main cause of this event was that I did not read the words 'land at the nearest suitable airport' carefully enough and fully comprehend what it was saying. At the time; our destination was the nearest suitable airport in my mind; and once I had decided that; I had tunnel vision focus and did not consider alternatives.Moving forward; I will be aware of my tendency to set up this tunnel vision so that I'm easily able to come out of it and consider alternatives to my plan if needed. I will not say that it was an unsafe decision to continue to destination; in fact I feel as though my decision was well-founded. However; the fact still remains that it was indeed technically contrary to the language used in the QRH.\nClimbing out of 17;500 ft. for 19;000 ft. we got a master warning left oil pressure. The Captain immediately monitored the instruments and transferred the controls to me. The QRH instructed him to reduce power to idle in the affected engine. As he was pulling thrust to idle in that engine we had n2 vib n1 vib and audible vibration sound that could be felt through the cabin accompanied by the smell of burning. Around this time ITT began to spike as well. We [advised ATC] at 18000 ft. about 180 miles from our destination (to the best of my knowledge). We secured the engine via the QRH and decided to continue due to the fact that we had several checklists to run; notification to the passengers and Flight Attendant; and to the company and would be at our destination in about the time that process would take. The left engine was secure so we both agreed to ask ATC direct our destination. A suitable airport was below us at the time of the incident; however; in our mind was not the best place for landing due to the criteria listed above. On the ground; Maintenance said an oil pump was disconnected to the assembly box that caused the engine to degress the way it did.", {"entities": [[1615, 1623, "WEATHER"], [5, 10, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [70, 76, "AIRPLANE"], [90, 103, "CREW"], [218, 226, "CREW"], [231, 234, "CREW"], [304, 318, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [367, 370, "ABBREVIATION"], [394, 398, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [586, 595, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [881, 885, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1535, 1538, "ABBREVIATION"], [1540, 1548, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1556, 1565, "ALTITUDE"], [1571, 1580, "ALTITUDE"], [1629, 1636, "CREW"], [1715, 1718, "ABBREVIATION"], [1774, 1780, "AIRPLANE"], [1823, 1829, "AIRPLANE"], [1910, 1915, "AIRPLANE"], [2010, 2013, "CREW"], [2018, 2026, "ALTITUDE"], [2111, 2117, "AIRPLANE"], [2126, 2129, "ABBREVIATION"], [2365, 2371, "AIRPLANE"], [2408, 2411, "CREW"], [2602, 2613, "CREW"], [2684, 2690, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["During approach to the runway we went down to minimums and began to execute a missed approach. I disconnected the autopilot and advanced the power to climb and called for go-around thrust flaps 8. The positive rate gear up call was missed; but I believe I called for speed mode and nav mode as briefed with the First Officer beforehand. The First Officer became busy on the radios and flying the airplane became a secondary thing. Our speed accelerated as I pitched down to maintain 3;000 ft. as assigned. However the flaps were still extended and I reduced the power quickly to avoid over speeding the flaps. As that occurred I lost situational awareness and began to get spatially disoriented as I checked to see what was going on. In doing so we banked into a 30 degree bank to the left and began to lose altitude. Our airspeed quickly increased to 280 kts. and we got a 'sink rate; pull up' aural alerter. I recovered the airplane from a bad situation and was then able to clean up and get the airplane back into a stable stage in flight.I believe pushing the limits of my abilities in a new aircraft to me was a contributing factor. Although the First Officer and myself were legal to fly together; and the weather was legal for us to Dispatch; I believe our lack of experience and abilities were a contributing factor. This was also my 5th day of duty. Although I felt rested physically; I believe mental fatigue played a role.Although the First Officer and I had briefed the missed approach procedure and call outs; it still wasn't enough. I need to slow things down and make sure that both of us are doing our jobs. I also believe I need to speak up if I feel uncomfortable about a situation.

	["1. Situation: G650ER was in flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 and diverted to ZZZZ2 due to flight control surface failure. Landing was made without any injury to personnel or damage to the aircraft. Aircraft was able to taxi off the runway and continue to parking where the aircraft was secured.1.a.  Crew Alerting System (CAS) messages at FL470 and 250KCAS while en route: Two [2) observed CAS messages appeared. 1) AMBER FCS Maintenance Required; and 2) AMBER FCS Spoiler Panel Fail. PIC then initiated a CYAN CAS Event Record. At this point there are three [3) messages showing on the CAS stack.1.b.  Initial Actions - Maintain Control of the Aircraft: PIC was Pilot Flying (PF) and immediately assigned duties. PF remained flying and handled ATC communication. Pilot Monitoring (PM) was to refer to Checklist actions and remain as monitoring pilot. G650ER QRH was referenced. At this point PF was able to maintain control of the aircraft and flight path was not compromised. No degradation of control was experienced after the messages appeared with aircraft remaining in NORMAL FCC Mode. AP1 remained engaged after the CAS messages appeared. After scanning the rest of the aircraft systems pages; in particular the hydraulics; there were no other symptoms showing.1.c. Analyze the Situation - QRH: After a short discussion of the problem between the crew; the QRH was referenced in the following areas.  AMBER CAS Spoiler Panel Fail procedures (G650ER QRH). Spoiler Panel Failure (G650ER QRH). Flight Control Surface Failure Inhibiting Protection Logic on Remaining Surfaces (G650ER AFMS G650ER). AMBER CAS FCS Maintenance Required (G650ER QRH). Landing Urgency Considerations (G650ER). Abnormal Procedures 03-00-10 General Guidance (G650ER AFM).1.d. Take Action as Necessary: 1.d.1. It was clear to the PIC that after running the Gulfstream checklists; that a LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE scenario may quickly develop as the final option (G650 AFMS G650ER). After a short analysis of possible divert airfields; and after checking current airfield weather; a plan was made to divert to ZZZZ2 if necessary. PIC briefed the crew on the assigned duties needed during the QRH actions. Flight Attendants were advised by the PIC of the situation; and made aware that troubleshooting procedures will be implemented; finally asking that the cabin to be made ready for a possible divert.1.d.2. PIC then organized the cockpit for an approach into  ZZZZ2 and preset the FMS and navaids for the ILS Runway 19R; this would reduce workload during a subsequent approach. Weather was checked; landing distances analyzed; and threats discussed. If a flight controllability check was needed; PIC discussed how that was to be done over the ZZZZ2 airspace.1.d.3. After questions and comments were taken from all crew members; PIC asked that the cabin be made ready in case any flight control problems encountered during the FLT CONTROL RESET Switch is pressed; which is part of the QRH procedures. All passengers were asked to be seated and secured. Flight Attendants confirmed to PIC when this was done.1.d.4. With the plan briefed; and everyone staged properly; PIC finalized the assigned duties and initiated QRH actions. Start point is FL470 250 KCAS with ZZZZ2 to our front approximately 130 miles. PF was flying; PM would read and/or work checklists and handle radio communication. First QRH action; AMBER CAS Spoiler Panel Fail procedures (G650ER QRH) were accomplished; message did not clear; PIC is now hand flying the aircraft. Next QRH action; Spoiler Panel Failure (G650ER QRH) procedures were accomplished followed thereafter by referencing the Flight Control Surface Failure Inhibiting Protection Logic on Remaining Surfaces (G650ER AFMS G650ER). The AMBER CAS FCS Maintenance and Spoiler Panel Fail messages did not clear. Per the checklist; AP was to remain off and LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.1.d.5. Approach and Landing: PIC initiated the LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE plan. [Distress call] was initiated to support our effort to land without delay as specified in the Gulfstream checklist. Nature of the distress was described to the air traffic controller as an aircraft flight surface malfunction. Controllers facilitated a descent and approach without any problems or unusual maneuvering. Aircraft was hand flown in IMC on the ILS Runway 19R. On landing; spoilers were manually deployed by the PM and no controllability issues encountered. Controllability was not compromised during the portion of the flight after the FLT CONTROL RESET SWITCH was pressed and the Flight Control Laws remained in NORMAL MODE.

There appears to be a lack of pre-charted information with WAT (Weight; Altitude; Temperature) inputs to assist in rapid climb assessment.Publish a WAT (Weight; Altitude; Temperature) based chart for aircraft based on a worst case track distance off selected runways at ORD for specific runways...basically a Regulated Takeoff Graph (RTOG). Suggest ORD implement more RNAV SIDs...track distance on established procedures is key. Crews may want to consider requesting headings other than 180 on the ORD5 as well; or request other departure runways with more frequency.\nTook off ORD Runway 22L on ORD5 [departure]. Assigned heading 180 after takeoff. Turned to heading 180 passing 2;200 feet MSL. Noted that we would not make climb gradient. I notified ATC of inability to make altitude restrictions. ATC noted possible deviation and gave contact number.Taking off 22L the 5.5 and 8.5 DME rings are very close after [takeoff]. Being turned to 180 after [takeoff] narrows the distance. Reviewing climb charts prior to [takeoff] it did not seem to be a problem to achieve 700-1;000 FPM climb rate to meet altitude/DME gates. Not being an RNAV SID we had no indications that we would be challenged to make restrictions while on the ground. Once airborne and turning 180 heading and cleaning the aircraft up we determined we were unable to make constraints. I made an immediate call to ATC notifying them of inability. ATC was interested why we had not informed Tower. I advised we had no indications that we would not be able to meet those restrictions until airborne. We put GCO 5 and 8 DME rings in fix page which actively displayed on the Nav display (FMS fix page does not allow .5 or other less than a whole number. Additionally I had GCO hard tuned on my VOR receiver to enhance pilot awareness.Suggestions: 1. ATC should establish and use RNAV departures. Crews would be able to determine ability to make crossing restrictions while on the ground with more assuring. 2. ATC should not turn aircraft on a 180 heading from 22L. This makes meeting altitudes very challenging. 3. Do not accept southbound turns off 22L. Request RWY 28R. 4. FLT OPS tech could publish climb data with turns to the south off RWY 22L. This seems to be the highest risk RWY and departure turn due to the proximity to MDW from this RWY.", {"entities": [[195, 203, "WEATHER"], [1421, 1429, "WEATHER"], [40, 49, "CREW"], [119, 126, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [189, 194, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [251, 254, "CREW"], [256, 259, "CREW"], [422, 427, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [452, 455, "ABBREVIATION"], [538, 543, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [634, 641, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [812, 817, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [950, 957, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [978, 985, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1059, 1063, "ABBREVIATION"], [1230, 1237, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1259, 1267, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1331, 1338, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1370, 1380, "ALTITUDE"], [1381, 1384, "ABBREVIATION"], [1415, 1420, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1442, 1445, "CREW"], [1490, 1493, "CREW"], [1543, 1553, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1574, 1577, "ABBREVIATION"], [1606, 1613, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1643, 1650, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1684, 1689, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1707, 1714, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1769, 1772, "ABBREVIATION"], [1773, 1778, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1801, 1804, "ABBREVIATION"], [1825, 1829, "ABBREVIATION"], [1830, 1833, "ABBREVIATION"], [2071, 2074, "CREW"], [2104, 2107, "CREW"], [2147, 2152, "CREW"], [2274, 2277, "ABBREVIATION"], [2341, 2344, "ABBREVIATION"], [2447, 2450, "ABBREVIATION"], [2471, 2476, "CREW"], [2503, 2506, "CREW"], [2532, 2536, "ABBREVIATION"], [2663, 2666, "CREW"], [2817, 2820, "ABBREVIATION"], [2856, 2861, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2895, 2898, "ABBREVIATION"], [2938, 2941, "ABBREVIATION"], [2999, 3002, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

	["While getting dispatched for a routine instruction flight; Dispatch informed me there may be an issue with the annual for the aircraft not being found in the maintenance logs during a previous checkride oral that day. I was told to go look into it before the flight. I went through the entire maintenance logs for the aircraft; found no annual inspection done; and went out to the airplane to check the date on its airworthiness certificate (since the airplane is very new). I went out to the aircraft; checked the airworthiness date; and found it to be [date1]; meaning it would have needed its first annual inspection done by [date2] to be legal to fly. I told the student we weren't going to fly the airplane; and we went back inside to Dispatch. They told us there to go report to Maintenance to have them clear it up; so the student and I headed up there with the logs. There we met with the head of Maintenance; and the Chief Flight Instructor for the school just happened to be there as well. I handed the logs to the head of Maintenance; and he proceeded to flip through them a few times before he closed them and told us it was good and to go fly. I asked him to show me in the logs where it showed the airplane was legal to fly; and he told me to just go fly. When I asked again if the airplane was legal to fly; he told me and my student to shake our heads yes and go. At that point the student and I left; and I told the student there was no way we were flying that aircraft. We canceled the lesson and the student went home. Another instructor that was present when I initially reviewed the logs then decided to go up to Maintenance to check the logs of the other airplanes that were delivered the same time as the one in question. He was intercepted by the head of Maintenance and told he couldn't look at the logs; and would be shown them later. Both of us instructors plus another one reviewed our logbooks afterwards and found out all three of us have flown the airplane since it was [suspected to be] out of annual; as have probably most of the instructors employed by the company. About an hour after this; the three of us were called into the Chief Flight Instructor's office. There he yelled at all three of us; telling us we were starting rumors about airplanes' airworthiness; and tarnishing the character of our head of Maintenance; who was about to receive a maintenance excellence award; and that the annual was in fact done [date3] and that there was just an error logging it. He told us to be quiet about this and not file any reports. He also mentioned that this issue was present with another aircraft in the fleet; but not specifying which one it was. The chief seemed very defensive and upset at us. After we were released someone in Dispatch mentioned the annual was erroneously put into our scheduling software as having been done in [month]; which seems to be a logical reason for the mistake to happen in the first place. It is my belief that the annual for these aircraft were never done. After the incident us three instructors canceled our flights for the rest of the day. We noticed that the aircraft in question was flying again within an hour of us leaving work; and continued to go on flights the rest of the night and the next day.\nMy student was taking his instrument check-ride and during the ground; they examined the logbooks. During the examination; they couldn't find the annual inspection. The aircraft was due for an annual inspection in [month year]. After finding this information I looked at the logbooks and confirmed that there was no annual inspection done since [12 months earlier] making the aircraft unairworthy starting [date]. I looked in my logbook to see if I had flown that aircraft since [date]; and I had one time. There were two other flight instructors with me at the time that also checked their logbooks to see if they had flown that aircraft; and they had. We talked through our options and decided to talk to Maintenance and see if we were missing anything. The other two instructors went to see the logs and Maintenance said the aircraft was fine and to go fly. Maintenance refused to produce the logs. When asked to see the logs the answer was 'not right now'. The instructor who was scheduled on the aircraft decided not to fly since the logs were refused to be produced. About 30 min after this myself and the 2 instructors that questioned this were called into the Chief's office. We were then reprimanded for 'starting rumors' what we saw was 'a sticker issue' and that our maintenance person was 3 years away from some award and we were compromising that by looking into this. We were then told that this is a non-issue and we don't need to concern ourselves with it anymore. I believe this is due to our company culture at a management level. I believe a solution for this is an outside auditing system of our records to make sure we are not missing anything. My main concern is that the logbooks are going to be altered to reflect an annual that wasn't actually done; or was done but after the date listed in the logbook. We are not able to see maintenance information on our flight school management program and have been kept in the dark on things. I think full transparency needs to happen so we can stay up to date on everything that is happening with the aircraft we as flight instructors are operating. We believe the same issue might have happened on one other aircraft but we did not directly witness it on the second aircraft.", {"entities": [[59, 67, "CREW"], [158, 169, "CREW"], [293, 304, "CREW"], [651, 654, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [695, 698, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [740, 748, "CREW"], [785, 796, "CREW"], [905, 916, "CREW"], [1033, 1044, "CREW"], [1152, 1155, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1234, 1237, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1265, 1268, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1318, 1321, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1466, 1472, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1634, 1645, "CREW"], [1779, 1790, "CREW"], [1969, 1974, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2344, 2355, "CREW"], [2384, 2395, "CREW"], [2766, 2774, "CREW"], [3157, 3163, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3729, 3734, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3895, 3900, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3983, 3994, "CREW"], [4083, 4094, "CREW"], [4132, 4135, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4137, 4148, "CREW"], [4301, 4304, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4554, 4565, "CREW"], [5128, 5139, "CREW"]]}],

	["I am an Aircraft owner. My plane's annual inspection was due at the end of [month]. There was significant weather on my intended route; southbound; to perform the annual inspection on my aircraft. On Day 0; I submitted a request for a special flight permit [\"ferry permit\") to ZZZ FSDO using the FAA's AWC system. I used instructions found on the FAA website to create the account; fill out the special flight permit form; and submit it for review. In the past; I have done this via FAX or Email. I am attempting to join the FAA in modernizing systems. My request was quite simple. I was asking for a 10 day extension to my Annual's due date (thus; Day 4 through Day 13). There was widespread icing and turbulence PIREPs and forecasts for the next three days. I stated in my application that I wished to avoid 'get-there-itis' as a pilot. The pressure of getting the aircraft to maintenance in a timely fashion may have compromised my judgment. As luck would have it; there was a 4 hour forecast window between two passing cold fronts which had created miserable flying conditions. I used this window. I am very concerned that the FAA's transition to new systems may be causing requests like mine to fall through the cracks. I feel that if the weather window did not appear as it did; that I would have been placed under undue pressure to complete a flight which may have had hazardous consequences; or been generally marginal with fewer 'outs' than my normal preference. A pilot with less weather experience; or a less capable aircraft may have made the wrong decision in my situation. If the FAA is to present a tool such as the AWC Portal; then it needs to use it. As I write this; the request has sat ignored for two weeks. If the FAA has no intent to use these tools (i.e.; a local FSDO preference perhaps) then it should not make them available for the affected region. Normally; when I encounter FSDO service gaps such as these; I am able to solicit at more favorable FSDO offices.

	["Shortly after breaking out of the clouds (approximately 800 ft.) while on the LDA Z 19 approach we received a low altitude warning from DCA Tower. We did not receive a GPWS indication in the flight deck. After passing BESSE we began our descent to 770 ft. as per the CDFA procedures at 800fpm. At approximately 5.4 DME from IVWH [1.4 miles from WEVPU) using Predictive Monitoring I detected we were just a little low (approximately 1300 ft.) and mentioned to the PF (Pilot Flying) to slow the descent rate so as to cross WEVPU at 1100 ft. The PF complied; however the time it took for me to state this; the time it took to the PF to take action; and the time it took the aircraft to respond allowed the passing of WEVPU slightly below 1100 ft. We continued the descent and shortly thereafter broke out of the clouds at approximately 800 ft. At this point we received the low altitude warning from Tower. At that point we were both looking for the runway and had a good visual conditions. Realizing we were low and slowly descending I asked the PF to disconnect the autopilot; hand fly; stay over the river; maintain current altitude; which took the PF some time to comprehend and take action. The PF then maintained altitude or a very slow descent until we had proper VASI indications. In the future I plan to fly all LDA Z approaches myself. This approach is challenging and things happen fast. Having to coach less experienced pilots during the approach and conduct other PM (Pilot Monitoring) duties is completely task saturating. The more I fly this approach the more I believe it should be a Captain only approach. I would also like to add that within 15 to 20 minutes of our beginning this approach there were 2 or 3 special ATIS reports as the ceiling was dropping rapidly.

	["During my initial climb to 5000 ft; I experienced a total loss of GPS signal on my Avidyne IFD550; IFD440; Aspen MFD and Garmin Aera 796. Flight was on an IFR flight plan in VMC. I reverted to flying V14 SGF V63 using VOR navigation from the IFD550. However; the signal loss also disabled the IFD's DME display to provide location along the airway. That required using the IFD440 to provide a cross-radial check for position along the airway. I was also able to use my Iphone 10 with Foreflight for situational awareness. That device maintained GPS functionality. Upon landing in ZZZ; all signals came back and displays were normal during roll-out and taxi. The same issue happened on the return flight around 5300 MSL in the climb. My troubleshooting including turning off the IFD440 (it was the newest radio and recently installed). Within 20 seconds; all GPS signals were normal and all devices functioned normally. I left the IFD440 off for the duration. Had this been a flight in IMC; it would have been quite a workload for situational awareness. I would likely have requested vectors to the nearest airport; but without DME; it would have increased the workload even on an ILS. I was proactive to have redundancy onboard (two radios; PFD/MFD with backup GPS; and a portable Aera 796. That redundancy didn't help in this case. A suggestion would be to provide a better awareness to pilots to discuss options/likely cause of a total loss of GPS signals across multiple devices. The airplane is currently in the shop.

The rest of the freight was showing as Lithium batteries in excepted quantities and those boxes we loaded in pit 6. These boxes were not labeled as DG (Dangerous Goods). These were large heavy boxes; one of which was a television.

	["The aircraft arrived the night before and overnighted in ZZZ1. We were to depart at XB:16 the next morning. The ambient temp at XA:15 when we arrived at the jet was -10 with a wind chill of -30.  During engine start the oil clog ECAM messages displayed momentary for both engines due to the extreme cold. Both FO (First Officer) and myself discussed the warm up of the engines. FO was the pilot flying the leg and the flight was non-eventful during cruise. There was a front approaching ZZZ and Dispatch was keeping us informed of the weather. I spoke to Dispatch inflight and we agreed to add ZZZ2 as an alternate due to the line of weather that was to the east of the field.  When we checked in with ATC we were told to expect holding on the [name] arrival at ZZZZZ at FL200. FO entered the hold and at this point the weather was between us and the field below our altitude. Since the descent would be around weather I called the flight attendants and had them prepare the cabin for landing and to remain seated for the remainder of the flight. After one turn in holding; at FL200; ATC told us we were going to be vectored to an arrival to the east of the field due to weather. As we started our descent; on a vectored heading; I started to smell a 'musty sock' odor.  I looked at FO and asked if he was smelling the same thing. He said yes and we both put on our O2 masks. I made a quick call to the back to check on the flight attendants. The number one said he didn't smell anything and the FAs (flight attendants) in the back said that she did smell 'some sort of odor'. I remember thinking to myself that I was starting to feel the same hypoxic symptoms I felt during Air Force altitude training. FO and myself assessed each other and we were both feeling much better with O2. At this point we were in a descent; on vectors; going to the east of the field for weather. I decided to notify ATC due to the fumes and not knowing if the cockpit would remain clear of haze because the onset of the fumes was so rapid. ATC quickly gave us vectors to runway XX in ZZZ. We stayed on O2 for the reminder of the flight. After landing and clearing the runway; I turned the aircraft bleeds and packs off. EMT and fire department personal checked passengers as they exited the aircraft. Cause: As I stated above the engines were cold soaked on startup. This odor has been linked to oil and oil seals in the engine and packs. Maybe the first real thrust reduction exposed a gap in one of the oil seals. Suggestions: This type of odor is associated with tricresylphosphate (TCP). When we landed Maintenance told us that the only way to test the aircraft was to start the engine on the ground and then smell for the TCP 'musty sock' odor. I find it unbelievable in a fume event like this that there isn't a procedure to take a swab of the cockpit or cabin to detect the presence of TCP; compound that would easily be found. There has to be residue left behind in the cockpit. When I went home I shower and scrubbed myself clean.\nOn descent into ZZZ in IMC; Captain and I detected an unusual odor. We donned our masks. I was pilot flying so I maintained control of the aircraft while the Captain spoke with the FAs (flight attendants) and ran the QRH. [We notified ATC] and we proceeded direct to ZZZ while deviating around some strong radar returns. Landed without event and taxied with priority to the gate. Aircraft was removed from service. My only suggestion would be immediate removal from duty. The Chief Pilot laid out our options; but left it up to us to decide if we were fit to continue duty.

	["During maintenance operation on the aircraft; my co-worker and I damaged the thrust reverser. We were scheduled to do overnight maintenance that included RTWO DAY/ QRH INSTALL/ ACMF;FHDB;DVDR;QAR downloads; and lastly a Engine 1 thrust reverser fault. Before plane arrival I did some research as to what needed to be done on the E1 thrust reverser. It was noted that it simply needed an operational test due to previous maintenance. Once the plane arrived me and my co-worker planned we would start with the simple tasks as the RTWO DAY; and begin to start our downloads. Once accomplishing the ACMF/FHDB download. I went back to the shop with a QAR download due to lack of internet;before I stepped away from the plane I had the computer attached to the front of the aircraft where the DVDR download was taking place. This is when I instructed my co-worker to only remove and open the fan cowl for engine 1; since I was focused on the downloads. He mentioned to me he did not have full awareness of the thrust reverser system; which is why I only instructed him to open and release the fan cowling. Once at the shop and completing the QAR download/upload; my lead wanted to tag along since he assigned himself to an airplane that would be arriving near our gate. Upon approach to the plane I noticed that my co worker was unlatching the thrust reverser cowling latches. I mentioned this to my lead since he was in the same vehicle with me and he stepped out to speak with him to notify him. I was not aware of what was spoken between them; because I walked towards the DVDR download that was being done but had failed. I stayed there and retried my download not paying attention as to if the latches were secured on the thrust reverser. Once my download was complete my lead had left to take care of his plane. At this point me and my co-worker were at the flight deck and we started preparing to test the thrust reverser. According to the deferral; the thrust reverser was deactivated and need to be activated. According to the maintenance manual (AMM 78-XX-XX) for reactivation remove screws; fairing plugs; remove lock plates; inhibition bolts from trans cowl. Then install fairing plugs with screws on the transcowl (torqued to spec) Lastly reactivate the ICU clearing the E1 REV INHIBIT. with all of this being accomplished I powered up the APU together and ran hydraulics. At this point I told my coworker to have the reference opened for the operational test of the thrust reverser; which he did. Being a two man job I was on the ground pushing GMO switch to operate the thrust reverser. Being in sync with him on the phone we began to operate the thrust reverser; for a cycle of 3-4 time approximately. During this cycle I heard a very loud cracking sound that didn't seem normal to me due to past experience. I could not see where this sound was coming from during those cycles since I had to have my hand on the GMO switch while operating. At this point I needed a new set of eyes; so I contacted my supervisor explaining to him what I was hearing and also noted to him I had operated the engine 2 thrust reverser to confirm the odd noise coming from ENG1. Being no sound on E2 it confirmed to me something was off. I rechecked the screws I had tightened earlier to see if I misplaced any of them but noticed they were all good. As my supervisor was coming to assist me it never occurred to me to check the thrust reverser cowl latches; since I was not aware if my co-worker had secured them. I had been to occupied and concerned with the failed DVDR which worked for me the second time. When my supervisor arrived we did the same cycles and he heard the same noise. He inspected it and didn't find much until he bent down and noticed one of the latches was slightly opened. We switched places and he held the GMO switch and I laid underneath the engine to see the forward transcowl latch; latched within itself but not securing the cowl together. Once I latched it to secure it; I noticed that the center IFS latch was completely crushed and bent to bits. I also noticed it had damaged around the latch bolts and cracking some of the frames around it. After this; it was inspected by other Mechanics and found significant damage. It was my negligence to double check the work being performed; it should have been a smarter action on my part to double check the work; it was my lack of awareness.", {"entities": [[755, 760, "WEATHER"], [7, 18, "CREW"], [77, 92, "AIRPLANE"], [128, 139, "CREW"], [164, 167, "ABBREVIATION"], [229, 244, "AIRPLANE"], [332, 347, "AIRPLANE"], [420, 431, "CREW"], [448, 455, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [886, 889, "AIRPLANE"], [899, 905, "AIRPLANE"], [1004, 1019, "AIRPLANE"], [1087, 1090, "AIRPLANE"], [1240, 1248, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1258, 1262, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1269, 1277, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1338, 1353, "AIRPLANE"], [1721, 1736, "AIRPLANE"], [1907, 1922, "AIRPLANE"], [1955, 1970, "AIRPLANE"], [2030, 2041, "CREW"], [2347, 2350, "AIRPLANE"], [2474, 2489, "AIRPLANE"], [2579, 2594, "AIRPLANE"], [2656, 2671, "AIRPLANE"], [3100, 3106, "AIRPLANE"], [3109, 3124, "AIRPLANE"], [3418, 3433, "AIRPLANE"], [3618, 3625, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3858, 3864, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["I turned final for the hospital helipad at 500 ft. AGL. I called final to STAT Radio and lowered the collective to approximately 45% TQ. As I lowered the collective I heard a loud grinding noise. At nearly the same time the crew asked what is that? I looked to the left side engine panel and saw the number 1 side filling up with cautions related to [the] engine such as oil pressure; temp etc. At nearly the same time I changed the aircraft attitude to gain airspeed and abort the landing. In moments the crew said they smelled smoke and they saw an orange glow on the left side. As I was turning away from the pad I reached over and shut off the engine. I established single engine ops and announced my intent to go to ZZZ Airport. During this time I was also watching for a fire warning indication illumination that might cause me to land sooner than ZZZ Airport. I asked the crew if they could still see an orange glow on the left side and they said no. I passed the Aircraft checklist back to the crew and asked them to read the portion on engine failure which they did. I continued my climb to clear the ridgelines between hospital and the airport. The crew asked if they should call STATCOM to have Aircraft Y repo to the airport to get the patient which I thought was a great idea. The radio operator had already thought of that and they were dispatching Aircraft Y. I briefed the crew on what we were going to do; a running landing to the airport. I asked the crew to ask the radio operator to dispatch fire trucks to the airport; in case I screwed up the landing or I had residual fire that I was not aware of. Before landing check completed I turned to land the parallel taxiway for Runway XX. As I was on base I changed my mind and decided to take the Runway XX. The parallel for Runway XX is not straight for very long and then it bends. At Night on night vision goggles; with patients I was not taking the chance. I added to the crew that we train for this all the time. A shallow approach to running landing is really a non event due to our training. On final I set up for the shallow approach. I allowed the aircraft to touchdown and come to a stop. Aircraft Y landed and transferred my crew and patient to Hospital. My shutdown of Number 2 engine was uneventful. The max TQ I remember seeing during the whole event was 101.5% Temperature outside was about -2C. The Mechanics showed up about 45 minutes later. Aircraft Y had been dispatched to recover the wheels and tow bar from Aircraft Z base. It took him about an hour to get back. Once he was there the mechanics put the wheels and tow bar on and cleared the runway. After I landed I called approach and told them that my aircraft was on the runway. OCS called the FSS to send out a NOTAM. Once the aircraft was off the runway I called Approach to tell them as such. I also called OCS to call the FSS. Inside the aircraft we worked as a team. The crew did a great job of providing patient care and providing information and checklist verification when I asked for it. The Radio Operator and the OCS were excellent. They were all about support without asking questions.

	["Downwind to base leg we encountered wake turbulence from an Aircraft Y; their position previously called by ATC. ATC traffic issued a traffic advisory; separate from the Aircraft Y that we were following. Due to our heading into the rising sun; we could not make eye contact with the second aircraft. ATC issued a clearance to descend to 3000 feet while we were presently leaving (approx) 7500 feet. ATC then queried if we had the airport in sight. F/O (First Officer) confirmed that it was. I began slowing the aircraft in anticipation of an approach clearance from ATC. We were issued a clearance to turn southbound (base leg). The landing gear was lowered; and flaps began to be positioned on flap speed schedule. I did not recall if we had in fact been given a clearance to proceed via a visual approach to Runway 24R. At this point; we queried ATC for that approach clearance. We were then issued a clearance for a visual approach to Runway 24R. I did not realize that I had overshot the final approach course; and corrected by turning to a more northerly heading to intercept the Runway 24R course. Proceeding visually; I had (what I thought) was 24R in sight. LAX Tower informed us that we were lined up for Runway 25R. We were re-cleared for a visual approach to Runway 24R; and I was able to proceed over to that runway in a stable landing configuration and land.

	["Critical events and  emergencies need to be taken more seriously. This incident could have turned out very differently. I understand returning aircraft to service in a timely manner when it is a minor issue; but when we are talking about a total loss of electrical power; that is a very serious occurrence. Certain things should not be rushed and there should be no shortcuts.  It is mine boggling to me that this occurred twice in a 24 hour span in the same aircraft. That is completely unacceptable and this issue and needs to be looked into.Descending on the arrival into ZZZ;we were given descend and maintain 2;000 ft. Around 4;000 ft. I heard a 'clicking noise' which sounded like an electrical component or contactor opening or closing behind the Captain's seat and an ECAM message shortly after confirming we had a GEN2 failure. The noise is what I hear when a generator comes on line after starting an engine or the APU. Shortly after we heard another 'clicking noise' and generator 1 failed as well. The aircraft then entered the ELEC EMERGENCY CONFIGURATION. We were left with only the RAT (Ram Air Turbine) and the electrical and hydraulic components associated. This occurred on a downwind to Runway ZZL in visual conditions. Due to the nature of the emergency and the phase of flight we [Requested Priority Handling] and asked for an immediate visual approach to Runway XXL. We weren't sure if there was an electrical fire or what the nature of the emergency was. We agreed to land ASAP as per the ECAM. We confirmed the gear was down and didn't have enough time to fully run through the ECAM or COM procedures. After landing safely the aircraft was met by fire trucks and we were eventually towed to the gate in ZZZ safely. It was brought to our attention after arriving that this was the second occurrence in 24 hours with this aircraft. Maintenance simply wanted to do a 'reset' and an engine run up and see if they could duplicate the issue and release the aircraft back into service just as they did yesterday. Our Contract Maintenance Mechanic in ZZZ didn't feel comfortable with that and politely refused saying this aircraft needs a more thorough check of the electrical system. Something is causing this issue with the electrical system and it needs to be addressed immediately. There is no reason this aircraft should be returned to service until we know what is causing the issue and it is addressed appropriately.On a side note we were also given the wrong logbook in ZZZ1 before the flight. Fortunately we caught the mistake and were issued the correct logbook. I think there needs to be a little more sense of urgency within our Maintenance department. We got an apology from the Mechanic; but if we had not caught the mistake we'd have been in a bad situation after an emergency and we don't even have the correct log book. Once in ZZZ; The Maintenance Controller only seemed concerned about getting an aircraft returned to service as soon as possible to prevent delays and cancellations. This was obviously the same behavior the previous night in ZZZ1. This isn't a simple deferral or something that should just be brushed under the rug. If you are losing both engine generators within seconds of each other; that isn't a fluke. With both engines running normal; this shouldn't happen in an aircraft with a properly working electrical system.  This is a serious matter and needs to be addressed immediately.\nReporter stated that the same type of incident occurred the previous evening on the same aircraft.\nMaintenance should try to put more effort into finding the problem of why something isn't working rather than trying to just get the logbook signed off ops checks OK. or could not duplicate. We have been seeing this more and more.I need to do a better job briefing even when it's clear and a million visual approaches.We were [flying] A319 flying from ZZZ1 to ZZZ on at approximately. It was clear skies with no wind. We were on downwind for Runway XXL at ZZZ in a descent from 4000 ft. to 2000 ft. We both heard a noise in the cockpit. The first officer asked if I heard something. The noise I heard sounded like electrical relays switching behind us. An ECAM message appeared on lower ECAM for GEN 2 FAIL. When I saw this I ordered gear down. My thoughts had already started towards trying to get the airplane on the ground sooner rather than later. We were in the traffic pattern at our destination airport when this all started to happen. When the gear came down we immediately heard the CRC; we lost the Autopilot; FD's; and Autothrust all at the same time. I also saw USE MAN PITCH TRIM in Amber above my attitude indicator. The First Officer lost his 3 screens and I immediately knew that we were in the emergency electrical configuration and this was going to be a Direct LAW landing. We turned towards the airport inside the final approach fix. We [Requested Priority Handling] requested fire rescue equipment to be standing by.We landed on Runway XXL at ZZZ. We rolled out to the end of the runway and managed to clear the runway. We stopped the aircraft safely; set the parking brake and shut down both engines. We had Fire rescue check the aircraft over. We never started the APU or requested external power to be plugged in. My thought was something is wrong with the AC buses knowing that we had just lost two generators within a few seconds.We made sure all FA's (Flight Attendants) and passengers on board were okay and we kept them in the loop and up to date with the information that we had.We requested a tug to tow us to the gate. Ground operation came out with a tug hooked up our aircraft and towed us to Gate. The Fire Chief continued to monitor us visually as we were being towed.At the gate we had external air hooked up and no External power. The plane was left at the gate with flaps out and RAT (Ram Air Turbine) extended. We made a logbook entry in the aircraft logbook. I called Maintenance control but couldn't reach anyone on [the] A319 line so I called the A320 line and finally got Maintenance to answer. I informed him we lost GEN 1 & 2 inflight and RAT is out. He told me that this was the second time this has happened in the last 24 hours.Contract Maintenance showed up to the aircraft. Maintenance Control talked with the Mechanic and I via phone and wanted the mechanic to reset the RAT and have us do an engine run and see if we could get the airplane moving again. The contract Mechanic told us that Company needs to bring in a team of Mechanics to dive in and see why this aircraft is tripping off generators.At the start of our day; ZZZ1 Maintenance brought us the wrong aircraft logbook. Thank goodness we caught this at the gate in ZZZ1 so we then had to call the Mechanics back out to bring us the proper aircraft logbook.

It is also likely the pilot of the helicopter mistakenly told ATC he wanted a 'North Departure' when he actually meant a departure direct downtown which is on a North-Westerly heading.

I cleared my right turn; and continued to clear it as best I could while continuing a right hand turn in a high wing airplane. As I rolled wings level on a heading towards the Tudor Overpass; Tower told me 'traffic is on a downwind for landing on the lake'. No traffic position or altitude was given. While Tower was transmitting; I saw a 170 on skis appear about 50 ft. above me at my 12:30 moving 11:30; and between 1/8 and 1/4 mile. I immediately stopped [the] climb so as not to fly into the 170; stated that I had the traffic in sight and would stay away from him. After my blood pressure went back to normal; I asked the Tower if 'he ever saw me' to which the Tower replied; 'no'. Then I said on air 'That was unacceptable traffic clearance'; flew my departure; and never got any response back so switched to CTAF as per the Chugach Transition. The Tower made a mistake by clearing an aircraft to climb in a right turn; directly towards the known flight path of an aircraft that was descending in the pattern. I never received notice to scan for traffic or any traffic alert at all until the other plane was filling up my windshield at close range. I do not know if the skiplane was told to look for my 172. If I had not been climbing with a slow rate of climb; the airplanes would have collided in midair; no question; as he descended on top of me while I was in a right turn. The Tower should have seen the potential conflict; and could have done any number of other things than they did. They could have not cleared me to take off until that skiplane was clear; they could have told me about the skiplane at any point PRIOR to almost colliding; they could have told me to stop turn or vector me left; they could have vectored the skiplane away from his path; etc. I called the Tower upon my return and very nicely asked to talk about a traffic separation issue that had happened. The man on the other end of the phone said that that had been him; and that they were in the middle of the shift changeover briefing when it occurred; that the 170 flew its base 'early'; that I had called the aircraft in sight; basically had all sorts of defensive remarks when I didn't come at him offensively. I specifically said that I didn't want anyone to get in trouble but that we should talk about it so we could all work together to reduce the chances of it happening in the future. I'm not sure anything was learned; as he never stated that anything went wrong; or that normal accepted traffic separation was compromised. I think he was afraid of getting in trouble. I will be reporting this to the FAA as I have a sneaky suspicion that the Controller; due to the fact that he was the person to answer the phone; will try to keep this quiet and not add it to any near miss reports. Lake Hood has hundreds of near misses a year; and the accepted levels of safety are absolutely out of whack with what is accepted anywhere else; even at other towered airports in the region; such as Merrill Field. It almost seems as if many of the controllers at Lake Hood think that traffic separation in their airport area is optional; given the lack of traffic calls that occur on a regular basis. I have flown all over the world and it's egregious. Lake Hood Tower and the pilots in their airspace need to be held accountable for safety violations and we should also have a change in the airspace due to its business.There is so much traffic in the Lake Hood segment and north of Anchorage in the practice area; that I think it is time to admit it's too much traffic for the level of airspace to be justified. In the interest of safety; I strongly believe that we need to change the airspace to Class C all the way from Lake Hood to 30 miles north of Anchorage; except for a 700 foot layer where all the non certificated [people] can hang out if they want to. The rest of us who want to be safe ( MANY ) are tired of being afraid for our lives on a regular basis; and it is [the] Government's responsibility to change it.

On preflight at ZZZ1 RNAV (GPS) Rwy XX Approach was programmed into FMS2 by FO. FMS1 cross filled from FMS2. At cruise during approach briefing it was jointly agreed to fly full RNAV (GPS) Rwy XX Approach via [initial approach fix] transition flying hold in lieu (i.e. not activating approach and requesting vectors to final). PF (Pilot Flying) directed PM (Pilot Monitoring) to request direct IAF from ATC. Clearance direct to IAF was given by ATC and flight crew set up VNAV profile to waypoint altitudes on the approach. Since Hold In Lieu was seldom practiced; PM and PF discussed how the FMS waypoints should present themselves on the Flight Plan page and Clearance Page of FMS. Hold was noted at IAF waypoint [holding fix]. The Hold in Lieu was discussed at length by the flight crew. PM brought Holding Definition up on PM's FMS which indicated a 'parallel' entry. Flight Crew discussed what to expect with a parallel entry to Hold in Lieu and expected a left turn when reaching the 'fly-over' waypoint. Flight Plan page was brought up on both FMSs to ensure waypoints matched.Approach Control cleared flight for the approach and if I recall correctly gave a crossing altitude of 6;000 or higher at IAF. After approach clearance was received and IAF restriction was ensured; the altitude alerted was set to field elevation. As briefed; PF slowed airplane to 200 KIAS prior to capturing [holding fix] in preparation for hold in lieu. Immediately following capture of fly-over waypoint aircraft made standard rate turn to the RIGHT instead of LEFT. Both Pilots were immediately aware the maneuver was the opposite direction of the expected maneuver that was briefed. PF began brief troubleshooting the FMS when airplane began a turn to the LEFT after turning approximately 60 degrees to the RIGHT. Aware of the terrain east of ZZZ; PM requested vectors from ATC to insure terrain clearance. Best estimate from onset of unexpected maneuver to calling ATC for vector away from terrain was approximately 20 seconds. Approach Control directed turn to 275. At this point 275 was about at the airplanes 6 O'clock position so PM elected to continue left turn using heading bug and HDG mode was selected. PM requested direction for turn from ATC and a RIGHT turn was directed as well as a climb to 6;000 feet. PF disconnected the autopilot and began a right turn to 275 and climb to 6;000 feet. Later; Approach Control directed a climb to 8;000 feet and enquired if we would like vectors to final for the ILS approach to Rwy XX. PF and PM both agreed to switch to an ILS approach. Although not discussed; I believe we both felt after the unexpected maneuver it unwise to double down on another RNAV XX Approach even if we intended to activate the approach and receive vectors to final. While still hand flying; PF directed PM to push STBY on FMCS and auto flight with autopilot in heading mode was re-established from clean state. PM loaded ILS approach to XX and this ILS approach was setup; briefed and conducted uneventfully.Recommend warning against any flight crews flying the full RNAV (GPS) Rwy XX Approach to ZZZ until the FMS anomaly above is understood. Recommend testing the RNAV (GPS) Rwy XX Approach at ZZZ in the simulator by attempting to duplicate the scenario described above. Pilots did not inadvertently disarm the approach prior to [holding fix]. There is no STAR into ZZZ so issues with setting up a contiguous RNAV Approach from a STAR did not exist for the scenario that played out.

	["We were being radar vectored for SDL; level 6000' MSL/approximately heading 050/200 KIAS. Traffic appeared on TCAS display 5 miles ahead of us and 11 o'clock; altitude was varying 200'-300' which suggested to me that it was a training aircraft completing a maneuver such as a lazy 8. A few seconds after seeing the TCAS target we received an RA (Resolution Advisory) and the PF (Pilot Flying) complied immediately by deploying the spoilers and descending at 2500 fpm per the RA. The controller was talking to another aircraft during this process. TCAS stated 'Clear of conflict' at 5000'; PF arrested the descent and I advised the controller that we responded to an RA. He said to maintain 5000'. Shortly after this while still at 5000' I spotted something shiny/metallic in front of us and it passed within 50' below the right wing. Believe it was a drone as it had a straight line (leading edge) reflecting sunlight. Received a second RA (monitor vertical speed; no altitude change) just north of DVT from a training aircraft departing that airport before landing at SDL.The airspace around the PHX area is becoming busier and busier. I believe that it may be helpful to take a proactive stance and explore making changes in the following areas (if not already in the works): 1) Formal education of piston training aircraft operators on the routes that ATC directs turbine aircraft flying to outlying airports in the PHX area. We were flying a vector that we see very often (began around TIRON intersection) and I doubt the first aircraft we received an RA from knew we were there. 2) PHX approach keeping turbine aircraft in the class B airspace as long as possible would be wonderful. When we're kept under that airspace 30 miles north or south of PXR; we often receive RAs and it's hectic because PHX approach is often unable see all the traffic we're getting flown through. 3) New charter arrival procedures for SDL-bound turbine aircraft could help solve this issue. 4) Perhaps the Class B airspace could be modified to allow for more protection (such as a 6000' shelf where we were operating).", {"entities": [[775, 780, "WEATHER"], [50, 53, "ABBREVIATION"], [110, 114, "ABBREVIATION"], [315, 319, "ABBREVIATION"], [444, 454, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [547, 551, "ABBREVIATION"], [605, 612, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [828, 832, "AIRPLANE"], [1028, 1037, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1058, 1065, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1355, 1358, "CREW"], [1367, 1374, "AIRPLANE"], [1384, 1390, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1437, 1443, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1496, 1508, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1591, 1599, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1608, 1615, "AIRPLANE"], [1806, 1814, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1865, 1870, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1928, 1935, "AIRPLANE"]]}],

	["On the listed date and approximate time; I was conducting pattern work and landings. My wife was with me as the passenger and as I turned from Left Crosswind to Left Downwind for the runway my wife pointed out that Aircraft Y had crossed under my plane from my right and entered left downwind parallel to me and between my plane and the runway. It was at that time that the pilot made his very first radio transmission that he had entered the downwind; would take number one and 'had me in sight'. I asked him what he was doing and if he needed to get in front of me and he said that he would get in front of me to do a short approach for a touch and go and get out of my way. Prior to this radio transmission there was no radio contact with traffic in this pattern and certainly no attempt to communicate with planes or get into the normal pattern. The pilot simply flew under me; passed me between my plane and the runway; and took the number one spot. Had my wife not seen the plane and pointed it out; I would not have seen it before it gained altitude to get ahead of me.There was absolutely no reason for his action other than he had the ability to do so and obviously had no intent to use acceptable communication with other aircraft and or follow normal pattern flight for landing. No [priority handling was requested] and no warning was given as to why he was flying under me in a very maneuverable airplane; to overtake and pass my plane.This is not the first time I have observed this particular pilot display this type of flying behavior and I believe he poses a great risk to the many pilots; both experienced and student/inexperienced; that utilize this airport.", {"entities": [[555, 560, "WEATHER"], [600, 605, "WEATHER"], [58, 65, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [148, 157, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [166, 174, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [183, 189, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [284, 292, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [337, 343, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [374, 379, "CREW"], [400, 405, "AIRPLANE"], [443, 451, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [626, 634, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [691, 696, "AIRPLANE"], [723, 728, "AIRPLANE"], [758, 765, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [841, 848, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [854, 859, "CREW"], [867, 871, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [917, 923, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1262, 1269, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1369, 1375, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1507, 1512, "CREW"], [1534, 1540, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1598, 1604, "CREW"]]}],
	["Departed ZZZ. The airport tower was closed. Was unable to request special VFR. I wanted to get as far as ZZZ1 and ZZZ2 for the night closer to home as Lake City forecasted rain all week. I would have been able to have a friend pick me up at ZZZ1 which was closer to home.The local TAF was reporting 500 ft. ceilings; but the route to ZZZ1 was all MVFR conditions between 1;200 ft. at ZZZ1 and 2;300 ft. at ZZZ3 reported along the entire route starting approximately 10 miles north of Lake City; FL.It appeared that the automated system at ZZZ was possibly sitting in the vicinity of a low cloud bank because as I was standing outside the FBO I could look North and see at least 1;000 ft. of ceilings by gauging the tops of 500+ ft. towers in the vicinity. Additionally; my flight planning identified all towers & obstacles along my route of flight whereas none where more than 600 ft. MSL. I developed a route on my G430 and iPad (Foreflight) that would keep me at least 5 NMs away from any obstacles. I also did not receive a weather brief prior to departure because my destination was only 50 NM away.As I headed north approximately 20 miles I was able to maintain 1;000 ft. with MVFR conditions as reported. Then; rapidly; the ceilings dropped as I was flying northbound to ZZZ1. I assumed at the time it was due to the swamps I was crossing over. I mistakenly started descending on the assumption that the low ceilings I encountered would only be a few miles since all the weather tools I utilized were forecasting MVFR along my entire route.As I dipped to approximately 500 ft. MSL I looked all around and saw where it was a 300-500 ft. ceiling in all directions. I elected to NOT make a 180 and turn back because I feared I would hit terrain or an obstacle. I made a command decision to immediately climb to 2;500 ft. in IMC. My aircraft is current on Part 91 IFR certification. I have about 15 hours of IFR training; shoot multiple practice approaches weekly; and have a home simulator that I have logged several hours in IMC flight. I knew that continued flight at 300-500 ft. would ultimately lead to controlled flight into terrain.I leveled off at 2;500 ft. to stay below any IFR traffic above and started making my ATC calls. I attempted to call Atlanta Center but assumed I was too far out for them. I made contact with JAX Center and stated I needed some assistance; but the controller told me to stand by as she was assisting another pilot in trouble. Fortunately; another pilot overheard me and suggested I switch to another frequency he gave me to coordinate help. I asked the pilot to communicate weather at ZZZ4 to me; as I have practiced dozens of mock approaches on the RNAV to Runway XX. He stated ceilings were 1;200 ft. at ZZZ4 so I elected to maintain 2;500 ft. (Minimum area safe altitude) to prevent a decent into terrain. I also elected not to try to make ZZZ1 or anywhere else because I had complete control of the aircraft; only memorized the approaches to ZZZ4; and have not had enough experience/training/knowledge of flying an approach into anywhere else.As I came to within 10 NM of ZZZ5 (approximately 12 miles from ZZZ4) I was able to look down and see large portions of ground terrain. I know all obstacles between ZZZ5 and ZZZ4 so I was confident for a descent back down to MVFR. I leveled off at 1;400 ft. and flew MVFR the remainder of the flight landing safely into ZZZ4.I spent the day reflecting on all the poor aeronautical decisions I made that day. First; NEVER trust TAFs or local weather reports without setting personal minimums of at least 500 ft. greater then reported ceilings as a personal buffer for errors in weather reporting. Second; NEVER try to interpolate en-route conditions between reporting stations as weather can be significantly more adverse between non-reported stations. Third; NEVER depart an airport in less than MVFR current conditions so you can safely return if weather deteriorates.Lastly; I personally feel that ALL pilots should have significantly more IFR training above the 3-hour minimum for the PPL. I spent the last year studying IFR procedures (Scan; Partial panel; approach plates; etc); spent multiple hours on a simulator in IMC; had about 15 hours in-seat hood time; shot dozens of mock approaches at home; remembered the JFK Junior story; the 188 seconds to live video; and tried to learn everything I could about the number one killer of VFR pilots...'VFR into IFR conditions' and ensured I could do the bare minimum to survive and get myself out of trouble if I came upon it. These were the only things that saved my life this dayI also learned that IMC trouble didn't find me as I always feared it might. In this case; I found it and made multiple poor decisions that contributed to this.", {"entities": [[172, 176, "WEATHER"], [589, 599, "WEATHER"], [1027, 1034, "WEATHER"], [1477, 1484, "WEATHER"], [1642, 1649, "WEATHER"], [2614, 2621, "WEATHER"], [3527, 3534, "WEATHER"], [3663, 3670, "WEATHER"], [3765, 3772, "WEATHER"], [3934, 3941, "WEATHER"], [0, 8, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [26, 31, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [74, 77, "ABBREVIATION"], [299, 305, "ALTITUDE"], [371, 379, "ALTITUDE"], [393, 401, "ALTITUDE"], [638, 641, "ABBREVIATION"], [678, 686, "ALTITUDE"], [726, 730, "ALTITUDE"], [877, 883, "ALTITUDE"], [885, 888, "ABBREVIATION"], [1095, 1097, "ABBREVIATION"], [1167, 1175, "ALTITUDE"], [1256, 1262, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1372, 1382, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1575, 1581, "ALTITUDE"], [1583, 1586, "ABBREVIATION"], [1634, 1640, "ALTITUDE"], [1805, 1810, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1814, 1822, "ALTITUDE"], [1866, 1869, "ABBREVIATION"], [1910, 1913, "ABBREVIATION"], [1948, 1958, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2077, 2083, "ALTITUDE"], [2158, 2166, "ALTITUDE"], [2186, 2189, "ABBREVIATION"], [2226, 2229, "CREW"], [2410, 2415, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2448, 2453, "CREW"], [2487, 2492, "CREW"], [2593, 2598, "CREW"], [2672, 2682, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2690, 2694, "ABBREVIATION"], [2733, 2741, "ALTITUDE"], [2776, 2784, "ALTITUDE"], [2972, 2982, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3049, 3055, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3059, 3067, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3110, 3112, "ABBREVIATION"], [3290, 3297, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3334, 3342, "ALTITUDE"], [3348, 3352, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3589, 3595, "ALTITUDE"], [3851, 3857, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3990, 3996, "CREW"], [4028, 4031, "ABBREVIATION"], [4110, 4113, "ABBREVIATION"], [4147, 4155, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4236, 4240, "AIRPLANE"], [4272, 4282, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4425, 4428, "ABBREVIATION"], [4429, 4435, "CREW"], [4448, 4451, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],
	["I departed ZZZ1 to return back to ZZZ from a solo XC flight as a student pilot. Before I departed ZZZ; I had experienced some issues with the onboard radios; so I called my CFI at ZZZ to get his input. Before takeoff; the issues resolved itself; but I had the chance to discuss weather with him and another CFI. Both agreed that I would return well before any weather was due to impact ZZZ; but that I should leave as soon as prudent and head straight back. After departing ZZZ; I received flight following from Greensboro approach; who later passed me off to Charlotte approach. About 20 nm NE of ZZZ; I began my descent because I saw what I thought to be haze or possible clouds up ahead. I went from 4;500 ft. to 3;500 ft.; eventually skimming right below thicker layers of clouds. Conditions continued to deteriorate; so I tried descending even more to find better visibility. I tried leveling off at 2;500 ft. but realized I could not see ahead any better; so I descended further to 1;700 ft. The last thing I saw was crossing over route XXX; which is about 7 nm NE of ZZZ; and then seconds later I found myself in total IMC with zero visibility in all directions. ATC then asked me if I had ZZZ in sight; and I responded with 'I don't and I'm having trouble seeing ahead.' Charlotte approach told me that Runway XX at ZZZ was 1 nm at my 12 o'clock; however; I ended up flying nearly directly over and past it; and never saw it. The controller saw that I had passed the runway and recommended that I turn left to a heading of 090. At that point; I felt like I was losing altitude so I made a climbing left turn and eventually made a full 360. At the end of the 360-degree turn; I caught sight of Runway 5's lighted rabbit trail; thanks to my CFI telling the airport FBO to turn the lights on. I rapidly descended and turned towards the final approach course; before making a no-flap landing with a tail wind and landing safely. It was not until after landing; that I was told I had flown into a fast-moving; zero visibility snowstorm.What factors/perceptions/actions contributed to it? The fact that the storm was very fast-moving cannot be downplayed; and I think this had the largest part to play in it since multiple CFIs said the system should have not arrived at ZZZ for another 1.5-2 hours later. I also believe there were a few human factors that played into this dangerous situation. Get-there-itis may have played a role; but I think my trust in the approach controller may have also led me towards continuing instead of turning around. When I was told the airport was only 1 nm ahead of me; it made me feel that the controller was telling me to continue; instead of realizing that I was still PIC.Corrective actions:Going forward; I will definitely make sure I receive more simulated and actual instrument training; but will also never hesitate to make an immediate 180 degree turn back towards clearer conditions if I ever end up in a similar situation again. This cannot be stressed enough to student pilots; and I feel that without the hood training I received only days prior; the results may have been different. All student pilots should be required to have all hood training complete before solo XC; discuss 180-degree standard rate turns under the hood; and also know how to request vectors; altitudes; contact approaches; etc. from approach facilities. Lastly; I should have [advised ATC]; and student pilots need to be told that that is always an option if they find themselves in a dire situation. Also; I think the controller at Charlotte could have recommended to me to [advise ATC]; as he heard the fear in my voice and knew that I was a VFR pilot in IMC conditions.", {"entities": [[278, 285, "WEATHER"], [360, 367, "WEATHER"], [657, 661, "WEATHER"], [869, 879, "WEATHER"], [1140, 1150, "WEATHER"], [1908, 1912, "WEATHER"], [2018, 2028, "WEATHER"], [2, 10, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [73, 78, "CREW"], [89, 97, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [209, 216, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [464, 473, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [523, 531, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [570, 578, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [614, 621, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [703, 711, "ALTITUDE"], [716, 724, "ALTITUDE"], [833, 843, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [905, 913, "ALTITUDE"], [967, 976, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [988, 996, "ALTITUDE"], [1170, 1173, "CREW"], [1289, 1297, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1375, 1381, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1475, 1481, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1771, 1774, "ABBREVIATION"], [1808, 1817, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1841, 1855, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1883, 1887, "AIRPLANE"], [1917, 1924, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1987, 1992, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2262, 2269, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2464, 2472, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3018, 3024, "CREW"], [3145, 3151, "CREW"], [3334, 3344, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3356, 3364, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3408, 3411, "CREW"], [3426, 3432, "CREW"], [3606, 3609, "CREW"], [3667, 3670, "ABBREVIATION"], [3671, 3676, "CREW"]]}],

	["The event began when we were cleared for the ILS 36L. We were following a heavy 777. Weather conditions were IMC with constant chop caused by light to moderate precipitation. The autopilot significantly undershot the localizer while attempting to capture from a normal 30 degree intercept. The aircraft began a series of sweeping turns to regain the course. The aircraft's reaction very well may have been caused by wake turbulence from the preceding heavy. The Pilot Flying disconnected the autopilot and set an appropriate heading to capture the localizer. While doing so; the aircraft's altitude climbed to approximately 3400 feet MSL. I noticed the aircraft in a climb and called out the altitude deviation. As Pilot Flying was correcting back to the original altitude of 3000 feet MSL; Approach Control monitor queried our altitude. As we corrected back to 3000 feet MSL; we had joined the glide slope. We continued the approach to a normal landing. The autopilot's poor performance; subsequent intervention; and potential wake encounter caused the aircraft to abruptly roll. This; I believe; caused both myself and pilot flying to fixate on correcting the roll attitude and focus on guiding the aircraft back to the localizer. By the time the altitude deviation was recognized; ATC had queried us regarding our altitude. I believe that myself and Pilot Flying were faced with a challenging situation that presented itself abruptly in poor weather conditions. I think we were correct in disengaging the autopilot and focusing instead on flying the aircraft; however; we should have maintained more vigilant on our scan. I believe the EMB's automation should be updated to allow for a more gradual and accurate localizer intercept.

	["We were on a flight from ZZZ1 to ELP.  We were descending on the MOLLY4. Runway 22 was closed so we planned on an RNAV (GPS) Y Rwy 26L. Our aircraft was not certified to perform the RNAV (RNP) Z Rwy 26L. Approaching the terminal area; we received an ECAM message for NAV: FM/GPS POS Disagree. It was VMC; and we quickly verified our position. ATC also advised all in the area that there was GPS jamming coming from a military installation. We opted to switch to the VOR Rwy 26L approach as it was the only other approach to the runway; and I didn't want to confuse ELP with BIF; the military airport less than 2 miles away.  We had intermittent NAV indications while proceeding to the airport for a visual approach. We turned final; and I used the VOR approach directions from the FMS for guidance as seeing the PAPI was a little difficult in the bright afternoon sun. The FMS VOR indications lined us up nicely for the runway and with autopilot on; it started descending us for the runway. About 6 miles out though; the CA (Captain) noticed differences in our FMS course depictions and aircraft positions. I turned off the autopilot; leveled off; and continued visually. At about 5 miles; I picked up the PAPI. We landed uneventfully. In hindsight; the [manufacturer] uses the GPS overlay almost exclusively for VOR approaches with only a bearing pointer to the VOR as the backup.

Descending we were at our previously assigned altitude of 4;300 feet approximately 15 miles southeast of the field in daytime VMC conditions with unlimited visibility; where we notified Approach Control that we had the field in sight. We were given clearance for the Visual Approach. The crew had thoroughly discussed terrain around the airport and had briefed the approach plate emphasizing the terrain with the highest point of the ridge that we would be flying over being 2;381 feet and the night obstacle on the opposite side of the approach being 2;855 feet which we would not have to fly over; but is approximately 5 miles northeast of the airport and final approach course. The Captain set 3;400 feet and began a very shallow descent towards the waypoint where we would intercept the glideslope at 3;400 feet while articulating the reason was to not cause any abrupt descents in order to cause the EGPWS to set off a warning. After reaching 3;400 feet as we were approximately directly over the top of the last ridge we would cross in straight and level flight; the Terrain Warning was set off with 'Terrain...Terrain...Pull-up.'  Immediately; the Captain began a slight climb of maybe 200 feet which quickly silenced the warning. We were quickly over the ridge and the Captain descended back to 3;400 feet where he intercepted the final approach course and began his descent on the glideslope. We landed without incident. I would assume that the abruptness of the rising terrain which we were flying over set off the EGPWS warning even though we were over 1;000 feet above the highest point of the ridge.

	["IRNMN 2 RNAV Arrival [to LAX]. Downwind to base leg we encountered wake turbulence from an Aircraft Y; their position previously called by ATC.  ATC traffic issued a traffic advisory; separate from the Aircraft Y that we were following. Due to our heading into the rising sun; we could not make eye contact with the second aircraft. ATC issued a clearance to descend to 3000-feet while we were presently leaving (approx) 7500-feet. ATC then queried if we had the airport in sight. F/O (First Officer) confirmed that it was. I began slowing the aircraft in anticipation of an approach clearance from ATC. We were issued a clearance to turn southbound (base leg). The landing gear was lowered; and flaps began to be positioned on flap speed schedule. I did not recall if we had in fact been given a clearance to proceed via a Visual Approach to Runway 24R. At this point; we queried ATC for that approach clearance. We were then issued a clearance for a Visual Approach to Runway 24R. I did not realize that I had overshot the final approach course; and corrected by turning to a more northerly heading to intercept the Runway 24R course. Proceeding visually; I had what I thought was 24R in sight. LAX Tower informed us that we were lined up for runway 25R. We were re-cleared for a visual approach to Runway 24R; and I was able to proceed over to that runway in a stable landing configuration and land. My biggest take-away from this event is to return to the most effective mode(s) of automation after an upset. I should have reengaged the autopilot. I also should have continued on the downwind leg until I had the aircraft configured in a less hurried manner.\nComing into LAX with SoCal Approach. We hit some wake turbulence that disengaged the autopilot. Captain hand flew the rest of the way in. SoCal asked us to call preceding traffic [in sight]. Unable to find the traffic but called the field in sight when they asked. SoCal gave us a significant vector towards the runway and a large speed reduction. Along with a confusing ATC instructions with a lack of visual clearance that needed to be clarified we ended up being high and fast. We were trying to configure and get back on glide path as we turned on the final approach course. We overshot the final for 24R due to a slow turn onto approach. The airfield weather was hazy and because of that when I looked up to verify our position I saw two parallel runways but didn't recognize the terminals on the right instead of left because 25R was a lot more visible than 24R. I was heads down monitoring the pilot flying configuring and speed changes in order to be stabilized. As we were realizing our overshoot Tower alerted us and we corrected the track and landed on 24R without any separation or traffic issues per our conversation with SoCal afterwards. It turned into a high workload environment partly crew induced by not reengaging the autopilot to reduce the work load. We had the field in sight but because of getting turned in early; the aircraft was high and the configuration and speed needed to be fixed. This caused ourselves to fixate [on] the vertical path and speed resulting in a slowing than normal turn onto final causing an overshoot. The hazy conditions at the field didn't help cue me of the overshoot to the south side of the field because of very similar looking runways in front of us and lack of visual of the terminal buildings. As we intercepted the final approach course I should have recognized the slow turn and localizer being displaced to the right. Along with having my map on the 5-10 scale it didn't allow me to recognize the overshoot due to it being on too high of scale for how close the final approaches are. I had all the required and recommended instrument aids up to help but due to high workload and weird visual picture that lured me into thinking we were correctly lined up. I did a poor job of monitoring the entire big picture and to help maintain our full situational awareness. My lessons learned are to understand the threat of parallel runway environments with less than normal or ideal visual conditions. Use the automation and/or strongly recommend it to the flying pilot better. And lastly to not accept a clearance if it puts us behind the airplane.", {"entities": [[67, 82, "WEATHER"], [295, 298, "WEATHER"], [1712, 1727, "WEATHER"], [2319, 2326, "WEATHER"], [3357, 3362, "WEATHER"], [8, 12, "ABBREVIATION"], [31, 39, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [43, 51, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [139, 142, "CREW"], [145, 148, "CREW"], [333, 336, "CREW"], [359, 366, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [432, 435, "CREW"], [481, 484, "ABBREVIATION"], [486, 499, "CREW"], [575, 583, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [599, 602, "CREW"], [651, 659, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [666, 678, "AIRPLANE"], [728, 732, "AIRPLANE"], [831, 839, "CREW"], [881, 884, "CREW"], [894, 902, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [959, 967, "CREW"], [1025, 1039, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1201, 1206, "CREW"], [1245, 1251, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1282, 1297, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1352, 1358, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1397, 1401, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1541, 1550, "AIRPLANE"], [1588, 1600, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1690, 1698, "CREW"], [1748, 1757, "AIRPLANE"], [1759, 1766, "CREW"], [1772, 1776, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1975, 1981, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2034, 2037, "CREW"], [2219, 2233, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2296, 2304, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2310, 2318, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2415, 2422, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2564, 2569, "CREW"], [2570, 2576, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2669, 2674, "CREW"], [2717, 2723, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2901, 2910, "AIRPLANE"], [3346, 3353, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3395, 3403, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3437, 3451, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3686, 3702, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4047, 4053, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4172, 4178, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4179, 4184, "CREW"]]}],

	["With my student flying we departed Runway XX. After takeoff; Tower advised us of two Light-Moderate rain cells. Not having flown this route before I did not know if they were on our route of flight; but I believed them to be. I stated that we would return to ZZZ1; our original departure point. We were told to fly our current heading; await further clearance; and switched to Departure. With my student flying I researched the likely new route. I looked up to see that we were 90 degrees or so left of our assigned heading. I took controls; righted our course; and continued climbing. We received our new clearance and a vector to intercept VX. At this time we had been in IMC with light turbulence for all of the time I had controls and some of the time prior to my taking them.When given a second vector to intercept VX; and 2;000+ FPM descent. My VSI maxes out at 2;000 fpm and it was pinned to that number. I reduced power to idle only to have my airspeed decrease. I returned to cruise power and slowly re-obtained 80 KIAS. I requested priority handling and requested vectors direct to ZZZ. I could not raise my left wing. I instructed my student to give me airspeed call-outs. While descending I was very aware of the oddity of my VSI and Airspeed disagreement. I believe I was caught in a severe downdraft of a weather cell.

I based my unusual attitude recovery power setting based on maintaining this airspeed with wings level being my first priority.I decided I was not going to die at that time.The stress of the situation degraded the clarity of my communication with ATC.I was later informed the Controller decided I was no longer in an emergency and told his supervisor I had stated I was no longer in an emergency.

I told the Captain to stop because the Embraer was moving fast and I thought the Embraer was the aircraft Ground wanted us to follow. The Captain immediately applied the brakes and we shuddered to a stop just short of B. Ground then called and said 'Aircraft X; keep it moving and follow the RJ on N2.' We both now saw the RJ on N2; but the Embraer was moving too fast on B; and we were concerned with wingtip clearance from the Embraer so the Captain did not continue the taxi. The Embraer passed in front of us with an unknown close wingtip to nose clearance (best guess was 10 ft.). There was another Embraer following the Embraer and Ground stated 'Aircraft Y; let Aircraft X out.' We proceeded to the runway in front of the second Embraer as cleared and switched to Tower once holding short of Runway 28R/N5.

	["We were assigned [gate] in ORD. While approaching the gate on the taxiway ramp control cleared us 'to the gate when wing walkers are present'. I turned towards the gate and saw the guide man; but no wing walkers. I stopped the airplane; and the First Officer called twice ramp control and asked for the wing walkers. Ramp control both times assured us that wing walkers were on the way. After a few minutes ORD Ground Control inquired what was going on since we were blocking the taxiway. Since the wing walkers still had not arrived; we were instructed to taxi to the penalty box. On the way the First Officer talked to ramp control again to make sure that the wing walkers would be present next time.

The wing walkers drive luggage carts onto the road; paralleling taxiway A to block traffic and then remain in the cab while the airplane taxies in. I returned to [gate] and parked the airplane. After thinking about it; I now believe; that I should not have parked the airplane at [gate]. This procedure is not written down anywhere. The wing walkers cannot observe the airplane and wingtips while seated inside the luggage cart cab. The instructions from ramp control were to have wing walkers present. Just because some supervisor overruled these instructions doesn't make it safer or gives it any sense.This event occurred because I followed the instructions of a ramp control supervisor. I should have parked the airplane and insisted on the wing walkers standing in a position where they actually can see the airplane.In the whole [company] system; wing walkers stand on the roads and stop traffic during push back or taxi-in events. I have to assume that this is too dangerous at [gate] in Chicago. Therefore; luggage carts are being parked on the road to stop traffic. I suggest that the wing walkers park the carts and then get out with wands and make sure that the airplane does not hit anything. They should not remain inside the cabs.

	["I flew from to drop off my C182 at the avionics shop. It was VMC and clear skies but at my destination with a 700 ft. ceiling. The ceiling was forecast to improve but I planned and filed an IFR flight. I checked all aspects of the weather; including dew point spread and icing; at the departure; enroute; alternate and destination. I reviewed all NOTAMS and the approaches and gave special attention to the fixes and altitudes for the RNAV Approach. I am familiar with the restricted areas enroute and the restricted areas and runways at the airport. All of which I reviewed again before the flight. I ran through PAVE; IMSAFE and personal minimums with no red flags. I departed in VMC. I climbed to 5500 ft. and remained in VFR over the top with clouds below and clear skies above for about an hour. From time to time I could see the ground through openings in the clouds. I checked weather updates at my destination a few times on my iPad and Garmin 530W. Although the ceiling had improved to MVFR at some point; I needed to descend through a few thousand feet of clouds to get there so I contacted Approach and requested IFR clearance.I had already loaded the RNAV Approach into the GPS. I was given clearance directly and to expect the ILS Approach. I requested RNAV and it was granted. ATC directed me to descend and maintain 5000 ft. and I complied; I also turned off the autopilot. ATC directed further descent to and maintained 4000 ft. and a right turn to heading 180 degrees which I did. Somewhere around this time I was in the clouds and became spatially disoriented. I was in a descending right turn that resulted in an unusual attitude; and then into an upset. I recognized the situation on the VSI and then the attitude indicator. My mind flashed to my instrument training. I pulled the power; leveled the wings; pulled up on the yoke; and began to climb. At this point I was extremely thankful to my instrument instructor for the repetitive unusual attitude recovery training. The event was very unnerving. As I climbed; I went into another right turn. My focus at that point was to remain calm and fly to a safe stable altitude; navigate back on course; and communicate with ATC for a safe instrument approach and landing. ATC suggested a change to the ILS but I requested to stay on the RNAV. I broke out of the clouds around 900 ft. and landed. ATC was extraordinary professional and stayed with me on the radio the entire time. I am extremely grateful for all the help they gave me.There are several actions I plan to do immediately to prevent this in the future. Complete additional instrument flight training; particularly in actual IMC or using a hood (no foggles). Develop a training plan to specifically address areas that led to this pilot deviation; i.e. hand-flying without the autopilot; unusual attitude recovery; and partial panel.Complete Upset Prevention and Recovery Training. Take an IPC with a DPE. Review/Update my personal minimums. Scan and cross check the instruments but return more often to the attitude indicator. It is easy to fixate on the avionics or other instruments.Leave the autopilot on; it would have provided both heading and altitude control while entering the clouds. I believe I may have gotten spatially disoriented when I looked at the GPS while turning and descending. Always set the heading bug to the new heading.

	["This was a flight from ZZZ to DTW. We were originally filed and cleared to descend via the LECTR 3 Arrival into DTW. During the descent; ATC amended our clearance to descend via the HANBL 3 Arrival. Any time a new arrival is executed during a VNAV descent on the Boeing/Honeywell Pegasus FMS; it takes up to a minute for the flight management computer to recalculate the new path. During that time period; the aircraft is descending unrestricted at idle and there is no path published for the pilots or autopilot to follow until it recalculates and presents itself.Originally; on the LECTR 3 the FMS had planned to cross HANBL at or above 11;000. When ATC switched us to the HANBL 3; the new crossing altitude at HANBL is at or above 17;000 and at or below FL210. The aircraft was descending during this period of recalculation and the new path did not present itself until the aircraft was at 16;800 just outside HANBL; at which time it leveled off. We were asked by Cleveland Center to say our altitude and we reported 16;800. Center asked us if we were descending and I answered negative.This is a recurring anomaly with the Honeywell Pegasus FMS and I don't know if ATC is even aware of what this does to the FMS when they issue a new descend via clearance while the aircraft is already descending via a different arrival. Virtually every airline places the bottom altitude into the Mode Control Panel when cleared to descend via a STAR; so the autopilot will not level off to prevent busting a crossing restriction that is above the bottom altitude if the FMS is in the process of recalculating the new path.", {"entities": [[75, 82, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [128, 135, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [137, 140, "CREW"], [166, 173, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [243, 247, "ABBREVIATION"], [248, 255, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [288, 291, "ABBREVIATION"], [422, 432, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [493, 499, "CREW"], [503, 512, "AIRPLANE"], [596, 599, "ABBREVIATION"], [652, 655, "CREW"], [757, 762, "ALTITUDE"], [781, 791, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1056, 1066, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1146, 1149, "ABBREVIATION"], [1170, 1173, "CREW"], [1213, 1216, "ABBREVIATION"], [1291, 1301, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1422, 1429, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1436, 1440, "ABBREVIATION"], [1449, 1458, "AIRPLANE"], [1561, 1564, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

	["My instrument student is in the final stages of preparing for his test. In order to do all the required approaches in a time-efficient manner; he has elected to do the flight portion at night; at a nearby Class B airport. That means conducting the test between 2 and 4 am. We decided to conduct a practice flight in the training aircraft which he rented.During our last approach; we both heard an unusual; subtle undertone to the engine noise. It sounded like we were in a twin with poorly synchronized propellers. A rhythmic 'thrumming'. I thought that perhaps one of our wheels was spinning.  When my student looked up; he deployed full flaps; and began to adjust his speed and match his glide path to the PAPI. A few seconds later; as we were on approximately 1/2 mile final; he announced 'I have no power'. I checked things. Fuel on BOTH; carburetor heat ON; throttle MAX; Mixture full RICH. The engine was running; but producing only idle thrust. I played with the mixture control for about 3 seconds before looking outside again and seeing that we had enough energy to make the runway. I told Tower that we would be full stop; with a request for progressive taxi to park the plane overnight. The time elapsed from the onset of the issue to being on the runway was less than a minute. After we landed; the engine behaved normally. On final; I thought I recognized the symptom as indicating fuel starvation. If we hadn't had the runway made I would have pulled the throttle back and tried a lower power setting. I've experienced something similar in old; carburetor cars. A few hours later; when it was light out; another instructor went to where we had parked; accompanied by two mechanics. They checked everything they could. Cleaned the plugs; checked the air filter; etc. They ran the engine up at various power settings for 30 minutes. They found no fault. The engine was normal.The instructor and one mechanic flew the airplane back to the home airport. Takeoff; climb; cruise; descent were all normal.

	["After landing on Runway 5 I was instructed to turn left on Taxiway A2 and hold short of Runway 9L; which I understood and read back. A2 comes out of an intersection which is a little confusing on its own with 5 spokes - it's an intersection of Runway 5 and an abandoned runway nearly perpendicular (which isn't well marked on the ground) with Taxiway A2 coming out of the north part of the X. Once I positively identified A2 and started taxiing on it I saw two sets of runway hold short lines within about 40 feet of each other. Naturally my first thought was I needed to clear the active runway I was on; then hold short of the next set of lines marking the next runway.Unfortunately; in this case they were reversed - the first set was to hold short of 9L and the next set was one for traffic coming from opposite direction to hold short of runway I was coming from. Essentially; there is no area where you are clear of both runways - you are either clear of one or of the other. As I crossed the first set; I made a comment to Tower about how small this holding area was; at which point he of course told me to stop; which I already was since I got to the place I thought I needed to be; between the two sets of lines. Obviously as I looked out of the side window it was clear that I made a mistake; so I apologized and no action was taken.Safety was never in question in this case since I could clearly see the actual runway I needed to be clear of which was still about 130 feet away; but technically I did cross the hold short line so that pretty much makes it a runway incursion. I review this kind of stuff all the time and I can recite you all the airport markings. If you gave me this question on a quiz I'm sure I would answer it right; while sitting in a comfy chair at home. But in this case expectation bias and a confusing intersection; especially after getting beat up in the pattern for an hour on a windy day ended up leading to this mistake.I've actually been flying out of this airport for a couple of years; and this intersection has confused me in the past; again because of the abandoned runway; it's just with normal operations I don't get go through it very often; but even being ready for it; it takes some time to figure out which is a taxiway and which is the abandoned runway. I think some better markings on ground; or even some traffic cones would help. As far as the hold short lines I think it would be more clear if they were combined; instead of having an area in between; but I think the fact that connector taxiway is reasonably short; runway safety areas overlap so it may not be possible.", {"entities": [[6, 13, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [152, 164, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [228, 240, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [270, 276, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [437, 444, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [469, 475, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [506, 513, "ALTITUDE"], [589, 595, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [647, 654, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [664, 670, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [843, 849, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [927, 934, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1030, 1035, "CREW"], [1057, 1064, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1260, 1266, "AIRPLANE"], [1422, 1428, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1475, 1483, "ALTITUDE"], [1569, 1575, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1665, 1673, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1838, 1850, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1892, 1899, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1979, 1985, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2038, 2050, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2111, 2117, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2263, 2270, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2298, 2304, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2326, 2334, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2544, 2551, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2573, 2579, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

	["It was my leg and we were at cruise flight at 40000 feet. We got an autofail light on the pressurization panel. I immediately grabbed the QRH to reference the emergency procedure. We started running the checklist. We had an autofail light with an uncontrollable cabin altitude. We then asked ATC for a lower altitude; but were not allowed to descend. The QRH directed us to go to alternate on the pressurization panel. We then selected alternate (ALTN). At this point the autofail light was still illuminated and the cabin altitude was uncontrollable. The QRH then says to go to manual mode and to manually open and close the valve as needed to control the cabin altitude. The Captain then began controlling the cabin manually with the toggle selector. He pressed the manual switch slightly and I started to see the differential pressure climb into the caution range and moving toward the max differential limit. I then heard the Captain say oxygen masks on and 100 percent. After I donned the mask I looked up and saw that we had exceeded max differential pressure. We established communication and checked that the seatbelt sign was on. The Captain kept running the checklist and I notified ATC that we needed a lower altitude immediately. ATC allowed us to descend to 36000 feet initially and then 32000 feet. I initiated an emergency descent and I continued to ask for lower altitudes and after consulting with the Captain I [notified ATC] for a pressurization problem. I asked for 10;000 feet and asked to divert. Meanwhile the Captain worked through the autofail checklist and had moved to the rapid depressurization and emergency descent checklist. The Captain was also communicating to the flight attendants; passengers and was attempting to contact Dispatch. After getting things stabilized the Captain and I came back together as a team to communicate what had been completed by each of us; so that we both could gain situational awareness of what had transpired. He told me that he had completed the checklist down to the deferred items and I told him that I had the airplane set up to land and was ready to brief him for the landing whenever he was caught up. We then briefed and continued uneventfully. After landing the mechanic verified that the primary and alternate pressurization controller were not working and he was suspicious that the manual mode wasn't working correctly. We did not receive the final diagnosis before leaving the aircraft. The Captain and I debriefed the flight and determined the following. Communication with the masks on made it challenging; but we were able to work through it. We did a good job of dividing duties to make sure that the airplane was being flown; checklists were being completed and situational awareness remained high. I would attribute this to our CRM training program.\nEnroute at 40000 feet the First Officer called our attention to an MCP overhead annunciation; caused by a fault in the pressurization system. The PRESS panel had AUTO FAIL and ALTN lights illuminated. The First Officer reached for the QRH in order for us to take an initial look at the accompanying procedure. Initially the First Officer began to go through the steps since he sat closer to the panel. At this point both of us noticed that the cabin was descending and that the DIFF PRESS was increasing into the yellow arc on the indicator. At this point I took over the QRH procedure and he resumed as pilot flying. He also assumed ATC communication responsibilities. I then asked him to request a lower altitude for us to perhaps make it easier to deal with the problem. Center responded with a negative due to traffic. Each step on the QRH procedure was followed in sequence. But at this point in the narrative I will only mention the steps that bear significance; or provide a turning point in the sequence of events. At this point the QRH procedure directed me to (step 5) select the mode to ALTN; which was done. The cabin continued as before with a slow descent and increasing cabin pressure. The AUTO FAIL light remained on and at this point the mode selector was placed in MAN (step 7). I then made one single short/snap toggle for the outflow valve (OV) to open to stop the descent and bring the diff press down. The result was a large (approx) 1000+fpm rise in cabin alt. It was even physiological as I felt the result of the rapid pressure change. Also the quick snap of the toggle switch appeared to produce a disproportionate movement of the outflow valve indicator needle. After a couple seconds I reversed the step and made a quick (single) snap toggle back to close. The cabin stabilized but now the diff pressure was in the red and climbing. Fearing an imminent and uncontrollable triggering of the positive pressure relief valve I called out for the First Officer  to don our masks and I went over to the Cabin depressurization QRC. We [notified] ATC after we began our descent via the QRC procedures; which included selecting PASS OXYGEN on. The First Officer was flying during the descent and did a good job of flying the profile and complying with ATC off vectors as well as adjusting speed for the turbulence and maintaining safe distance from some convective activity we needed to clear. While I struggled to get my glasses back on and readjusted enough to resume the checklist. It also took a few seconds to reestablish communications as his ACP (Audio Control Panel) got bumped out of the intercom position during the flurry of activity. At this point we [notified] ATC. Several attempts were made via service interphone by the cabin crew to contact the cockpit which were answered briefly with a 'stand by' but were apparently not understood by them due to mask noise. Center initially cleared us to 32000 feet; but then re-cleared us to 18000 feet then finally to 10000 feet; where we remained the rest of the flight. We were over water so terrain was no factor. Upon reaching 10000 feet we came off our o2 masks and resumed normal cockpit communications. I next contacted the cabin for an assessment. They stated that the passengers were all fine and that no injuries had been sustained. After a brief explanation of what happened I told them I'd get back to them in a minute. I then took a minute to consolidate; and make sure all the checklists had been complete and that ATC was fully caught up as well. I then attempted to contact Dispatch over ARINC but due to distance and altitude; was unable to establish a VHF connection. I proceeded to ACARS Dispatch to establish communications with them. We then discussed as a crew that we didn't have the fuel to continue to our destination at 10;000 feet. After coordinating with ATC and Dispatch we diverted. At this point the workload was reduce significantly and I made a PA to the passengers; explaining that our pressurization had malfunctioned and that the masks had been deployed as a precaution; and that we would not be able to proceed to our destination. Approach and landing were uneventful. After seeing the passengers off; the First Officer and I debriefed the event and flight as a whole. We both agreed that communication while on the masks made CRM more challenging; but we were able to overcome this to the extent necessary to make sure that we both were completing our tasks and maintaining overall situational awareness. The mechanic who met the aircraft and did the initial tests on the system made the statement that ' both controllers were failed.' He also mentioned that when he moved the outflow valve manually it was moving in a strange way. We noticed this as well.", {"entities": [[829, 837, "WEATHER"], [1057, 1065, "WEATHER"], [4023, 4031, "WEATHER"], [4376, 4384, "WEATHER"], [4655, 4663, "WEATHER"], [4759, 4767, "WEATHER"], [5154, 5164, "WEATHER"], [29, 35, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [46, 56, "ALTITUDE"], [138, 141, "ABBREVIATION"], [262, 267, "AIRPLANE"], [292, 295, "CREW"], [342, 349, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [355, 358, "ABBREVIATION"], [517, 522, "AIRPLANE"], [556, 559, "ABBREVIATION"], [657, 662, "AIRPLANE"], [677, 684, "CREW"], [712, 717, "AIRPLANE"], [838, 843, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [930, 937, "CREW"], [1143, 1150, "CREW"], [1193, 1196, "CREW"], [1242, 1245, "CREW"], [1260, 1267, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1271, 1281, "ALTITUDE"], [1301, 1311, "ALTITUDE"], [1338, 1345, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1419, 1426, "CREW"], [1439, 1442, "CREW"], [1486, 1497, "ALTITUDE"], [1533, 1540, "CREW"], [1637, 1644, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1660, 1667, "CREW"], [1698, 1715, "CREW"], [1758, 1766, "CREW"], [1804, 1811, "CREW"], [2097, 2101, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2222, 2229, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2467, 2474, "CREW"], [2700, 2705, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2843, 2853, "ALTITUDE"], [2858, 2871, "CREW"], [3037, 3050, "CREW"], [3067, 3070, "ABBREVIATION"], [3156, 3169, "CREW"], [3276, 3281, "AIRPLANE"], [3286, 3296, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3363, 3372, "AIRPLANE"], [3404, 3407, "ABBREVIATION"], [3436, 3441, "CREW"], [3466, 3469, "CREW"], [3672, 3675, "ABBREVIATION"], [3873, 3876, "ABBREVIATION"], [3956, 3961, "AIRPLANE"], [3994, 4001, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4017, 4022, "AIRPLANE"], [4217, 4224, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4305, 4310, "AIRPLANE"], [4503, 4512, "AIRPLANE"], [4621, 4626, "AIRPLANE"], [4802, 4815, "CREW"], [4899, 4902, "CREW"], [4922, 4929, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4999, 5012, "CREW"], [5017, 5023, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5035, 5042, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5065, 5071, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5103, 5106, "CREW"], [5525, 5528, "CREW"], [5587, 5597, "CREW"], [5613, 5620, "AIRPLANE"], [5657, 5662, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5760, 5770, "ALTITUDE"], [5798, 5808, "ALTITUDE"], [5825, 5835, "ALTITUDE"], [5938, 5948, "ALTITUDE"], [5993, 6000, "AIRPLANE"], [6038, 6043, "AIRPLANE"], [6336, 6339, "CREW"], [6397, 6405, "CREW"], [6477, 6480, "ABBREVIATION"], [6508, 6513, "AIRPLANE"], [6514, 6522, "CREW"], [6653, 6664, "ALTITUDE"], [6690, 6693, "CREW"], [6698, 6706, "CREW"], [6785, 6787, "ABBREVIATION"], [6975, 6983, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7050, 7063, "CREW"]]}],

	["Flight was descending for approach into GTF from the northeast. There was a ceiling at approximately 6;000 feet AGL; and a visual approach to Runway 21 was anticipated once below the ceiling. After descending below the ceiling; a large airport complex with a long runway oriented to the southwest was observed. Both pilots believed this to be the GTF airport and it was reported in sight to ATC; who then cleared the flight for a visual approach to Runway 21. As the flight continued towards the airport; the pilots realized that this airport complex did not correspond to the GTF RNAV 21 guidance that was being used as an aid for the visual approach. The pilots visually located GTF further to the southwest and continued the visual approach to GTF. Post flight investigation revealed that the large airport complex initially observed was Malmstrom AFB (Air Force Base). Malmstrom AFB has a closed runway surface that is nearly identical in orientation and length to GTF Runway 21. However; there is little or no indication of the existence of this facility on IFR publications. Because the runway is closed; Malmstrom AFB is considered a heliport even though it visually appears to be a large runway similar to GTF. This prevents the facility from showing up on cockpit avionics displays and electronic moving maps; because heliports are excluded. The facility does also not appear on IFR enroute or terminal charts. It does appear on the VFR sectional chart; but only as a heliport. The VFR sectional chart does not convey the similarity of the complex to GTF. Recommend that Malmstrom AFB be depicted on IFR charts; so that pilots are better aware of its existence and similar appearance to GTF.

	["Aircraft X was on a 6 mile final when I cleared Aircraft Z for takeoff. Aircraft Y was next for departure; and I planned on clearing him after the arrival. I turned my attention to other operational duties (such as VUO departure and practice scramble). When I turned my attention back to Runway 10L; I put Aircraft Y in position for spacing behind the previous departure; somehow forgetting about Aircraft X; and not scanning properly. Aircraft X was trying to call me when I cleared Aircraft Y for takeoff; so we stepped on each others' transmissions; compounding the situation. When ASSC (Airport Surface Surveillance Capability) alerted; I realized my mistake and issued go-around instructions. He turned and climbed before the threshold; so technically it was legal; but that doesn't make me feel much better. I was working combined local positions plus VUO advisory. There were three Military aircraft (one was a practice scramble and on my frequency) taxiing out to Runway 10R for departure; but they stopped in the EOR so I was frequently looking over to see when they would continue taxi so I could figure out a departure sequence. Also had a VUO departure call for flight following. Up until that point the operation wasn't particularly busy; but after the call for a practice scramble; it might have been a good time to split the position. One of the Tower supports at LC1 partially blocks the view of the final approach for 10L; and the controls for the arresting cables are on the other side of the Tower cab. Can't really fix those things; but it's good to be aware [of] their affect on the operation. After having had some time to ponder; I think the biggest factor was fatigue due to a lack of adequate sleep over several consecutive nights. My child has been sick; and I had gotten to bed late or was woken up in the middle of the night several times. I thought I was fine at the time; but in hindsight I was a bit sluggish and my reaction time was a split second slow. In spite of the issues listed above; I should normally have been able to handle all of it. I've worked busier traffic; and I'm appalled that my scan broke down this badly. I hate admitting that I was fatigued because it feels like I'm making excuses and showing weakness. However; I need to be realistic; and be better about recognizing when I'm fatigued to the point that it adversely impacts my ability to function; and ask for help and/or ask for sick leave. On a side note; I spoke with one of the pilots on the phone afterward. He was very polite and more forgiving about the situation than I deserved. The point he wanted to get across is that they have a lot of new pilots right out of school with very little experience.

I had lost track of the fact that I had an aircraft cleared to land on 36R. The ASDE/AMASS alarmed as Aircraft X was on half mile final and Aircraft Y was starting departure roll. I immediately sent Aircraft X around 36R and climbed to 4;000 feet; turned right to 090 heading. I could not visually see Aircraft Y to determine his speed so I did not abort his takeoff clearance.

Because these instructions came during a very busy period in the cockpit I not only misheard the call but got out of our normal procedure for a go-around. As we were turning; Tower again called to make the heading 090 (I think). My FO (First Officer) heard the altitude correctly and was climbing to 4;000; at about 3;400 I told him we needed to stop climbing and descend (more confusion) and we clarified with Tower and were told 4;000 feet; heading 090; and to contact Approach. We automated; configured; ran the checklists; set up the approach and landed without further incident. I'm filing the report because I'm still not sure about the 3;000 or 4;000 feet altitude which would be a possible deviation; and also to bring to the committee's attention that alternate missed approach instructions given immediately after the go-around call are dangerous. I make it a habit to brief or have the FO brief the exact steps of a go-around during the approach briefing and even with that fresh in our mind I still managed to get out of order. In this case the Tower Supervisor (I called after we landed because I wanted to know why we had to go-around) said there was Aircraft Y which departed just before we did and the distances were too close. I don't know where they were headed but I can think of a few better options than what we were given. First: landing would have increased our separation. Second; let us fly the published missed; the one on the chart; in our FMS and the one we discussed and are expecting to fly; and make Aircraft Y (or any departure) move around the missed approach corridor. Here are my suggestions. First; change this form to allow use of the 'enter' key so that I can break up this wall of text and make paragraphs. Second; ask Tower facilities to stop issuing alternate missed approach instructions; or; when they do; issue them prior to calling 'go around.'", {"entities": [[448, 453, "WEATHER"], [1205, 1212, "WEATHER"], [1217, 1227, "WEATHER"], [59, 68, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [97, 104, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [151, 155, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [230, 236, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [240, 246, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [303, 308, "CREW"], [369, 378, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [479, 486, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [714, 721, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [800, 804, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [962, 969, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [973, 983, "ALTITUDE"], [1096, 1103, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1415, 1418, "ABBREVIATION"], [1430, 1438, "ALTITUDE"], [1439, 1442, "ABBREVIATION"], [1452, 1465, "CREW"], [1505, 1514, "AIRPLANE"], [1534, 1543, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1553, 1561, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1580, 1583, "ABBREVIATION"], [1606, 1611, "CREW"], [1630, 1639, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1711, 1716, "CREW"], [1745, 1760, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1793, 1798, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1901, 1908, "AIRPLANE"], [2011, 2016, "CREW"], [2068, 2070, "ABBREVIATION"], [2072, 2085, "CREW"], [2124, 2132, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2187, 2195, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2247, 2252, "CREW"], [2267, 2277, "ALTITUDE"], [2307, 2315, "CREW"], [2374, 2382, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2387, 2393, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2488, 2498, "ALTITUDE"], [2607, 2622, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2664, 2673, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2733, 2735, "ABBREVIATION"], [2784, 2792, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2893, 2898, "CREW"], [2929, 2935, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2975, 2984, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3018, 3026, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3248, 3251, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3303, 3306, "ABBREVIATION"], [3353, 3356, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3413, 3428, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3594, 3599, "CREW"], [3637, 3652, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3714, 3723, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["We had an MEL on the passenger door power assist system which requires Maintenance to be present when you arrive and depart to assist in opening and closing the passenger door. The Flight Attendants were briefed of the MEL and the procedures involved to open and close the door before we left. While enroute I sent an ACARS to Dispatch along with a message in the in-range to have a Mechanic present when we arrive at the gate in ZZZ. During the in-range call to the Flight Attendants; I briefed them again on the procedure of getting the door opened properly. In the brief I told them that once we get parked at the gate and the seat belt and sterile light goes out; to not open the door until we get confirmation from Maintenance to do so. We arrive and shutdown and go through the shutdown checklist. From my point of view; I couldn't clearly make out whoever was by the door. All I heard were several hard knocks on the side of the plane. The passenger door was unlatched for a few seconds; a brief conversation took place between the Flight Attendant and the gate agent through the crack in the door; then the door opened unassisted; free falling to the ground. The door hit the ground hard and bounced twice. No one was injured during the event.I opened the cockpit door and went back to figure out what happened. The Flight Attendant said after the knock; the door was cracked open. She asked the gate agent if the door was ready to be opened and if Maintenance was present and that we needed them to help with the door. She was told yes several times and that she was cleared to open. Assuming Maintenance would take over; she let go of the door thinking that they were down there to catch it. Well; the person on the ramp who knocked was actually just a ramper who had no idea about the MEL and the broken door assist so no one was down there to catch the door. I contacted Maintenance and a write up was made in the logbook so that the door could be checked out and inspected for damage.There was a serious breakdown in communication but no one person is to blame. I sent an ACARS roughly 30 minutes prior to landing asking to have Maintenance ready to meet us at the gate. I also sent a message in the range (not sure if they really read it) that we need Maintenance present to open the door. That was two messages sent out at least 30 minutes prior to us landing requesting Maintenance to meet us at the gate. No one was there to meet the aircraft (discovered after the fact). Speaking with the Flight Attendant; she said she was told multiple times by the gate agent that she was aware of the Maintenance and that she was cleared to open.The MEL states under Operations: 'Flight Attendant will wait for the Mechanic to initiate the opening and closing of the door.' The word 'initiate' could mean several things. It could mean the Mechanic physically opening the door or; in this case; could be mistaken as a knock on the side of the plane. I've had this MEL several times before and every time a Mechanic opened the door from the outside. This was the first time I've had it where someone came up and knocked on the side of the plane. Given the scenario; the Flight Attendant had no reason to believe that the person wasn't a Mechanic since they knocked on the side several times. Even when the door was cracked open; she asked several times if everyone was aware of the MEL and that a Mechanic was needed. She was told yes several times. Luckily no one was injured on the ground but someone could have if they weren't paying attention. My recommendations are to better advise the ramp crews and gate agent of the door situation whenever an aircraft has this MEL and that only a Mechanic should be able to approach the door. I also want to recommend that a note be made in the MEL to state that a Mechanic should be the only person to handle the door when opening and under no circumstances should the door be opened by any Flight Crew.", {"entities": [[31, 35, "AIRPLANE"], [71, 82, "CREW"], [106, 112, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [117, 123, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [171, 175, "AIRPLANE"], [273, 277, "AIRPLANE"], [318, 323, "AIRPLANE"], [327, 335, "CREW"], [383, 391, "CREW"], [408, 414, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [422, 426, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [539, 543, "AIRPLANE"], [603, 609, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [617, 621, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [630, 634, "AIRPLANE"], [684, 688, "AIRPLANE"], [720, 731, "CREW"], [745, 751, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [874, 878, "AIRPLANE"], [957, 961, "AIRPLANE"], [1064, 1068, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1100, 1104, "AIRPLANE"], [1115, 1119, "AIRPLANE"], [1171, 1175, "AIRPLANE"], [1264, 1271, "AIRPLANE"], [1272, 1276, "AIRPLANE"], [1367, 1371, "AIRPLANE"], [1404, 1408, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1422, 1426, "AIRPLANE"], [1457, 1468, "CREW"], [1522, 1526, "AIRPLANE"], [1602, 1613, "CREW"], [1649, 1653, "AIRPLANE"], [1726, 1730, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1815, 1819, "AIRPLANE"], [1865, 1869, "AIRPLANE"], [1883, 1894, "CREW"], [1946, 1950, "AIRPLANE"], [2085, 2090, "AIRPLANE"], [2119, 2126, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2142, 2153, "CREW"], [2178, 2182, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2266, 2277, "CREW"], [2298, 2302, "AIRPLANE"], [2386, 2397, "CREW"], [2416, 2420, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2569, 2573, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2606, 2617, "CREW"], [2720, 2728, "CREW"], [2772, 2776, "AIRPLANE"], [2844, 2852, "CREW"], [2876, 2880, "AIRPLANE"], [3010, 3018, "CREW"], [3030, 3034, "AIRPLANE"], [3240, 3248, "CREW"], [3309, 3313, "AIRPLANE"], [3400, 3408, "CREW"], [3595, 3599, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3610, 3614, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3628, 3632, "AIRPLANE"], [3693, 3701, "CREW"], [3720, 3728, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3733, 3737, "AIRPLANE"], [3811, 3819, "CREW"], [3860, 3864, "AIRPLANE"], [3916, 3920, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["Upon leveling at FL240; we experienced a complete failure of AHRS [Altitude and Heading Reference System] system number 1; followed by multiple PFD & MFD screen failures on the Captain's flight instruments; along with an associated FD flag; and YD 1 INOP status message. I was the pilot flying at the time; and assumed manual control of the aircraft. Without any attitude or heading reference on my PFD I transferred the flight controls to the First Officer who still had working AHRS on his side; he would remain as Pilot Flying for the duration of the flight. We determined this as a time threat and created a plan of action. The airplane had just been on a mechanical delay; where they replaced the number 1 AHRS unit; so we knew it had some history on it. We decided to run the QRH for 'Attitude And Heading Reference System Failure'. After completion of the checklist; we were still unable to reengage the aircraft's autopilot; but were able to display AHRS #2 data on the Captain PFD. ATC was notified of the system failure. Dispatch was contacted; and after talking to the controller advised that they would like us to [return to departure airport] as opposed to continuing. The flight had been planned with round trip fuel so we had enough gas to make it back; and have a fallback alternate; and still over 1000 pounds of extra fuel.  We coordinated with ATC for a return. Both the Flight Attendant and the passengers were briefed as well on the situation and the decision to return. Upon initial flap extension; we received a STAB TRIM & MACH TRIM caution message. The QRH was run for the STAB TRIM Caution message; and initially resolved. Upon further extension of the flaps to 45; the STAB TRIM Caution message reappeared; the QRH was run again for the reappearance of the STAB TRIM Caution message; and directed us to use STAB TRIM CH2 for landing. We landed uneventfully; and the aircraft was written up and pulled out of service for maintenance. Mechanical Failure of AHRS unit. Despite having replaced the AHRS unit; it obviously did not solve the original maintenance issue; as we had it fail completely on us in flight. Not sure how to prevent this from recurring...It was a faulty AHRS computer/system.\nIn cruise flight the Captain's AHRS system went out and his FPD and MFD displays went blank and came back several times. The Captain also got a FD flag and we got a YD 1 inop status message. Captain did [a] great job working the problem and had me fly the airplane while he communicated with company; ATC; FA (Flight Attendant) and pax (passengers).

Next both the STAB Trim and Mach Trim caution messages appeared. Per QRH we prepared for a possible out of trim; stabilizer; approach and landing. After about 10 minutes we were able to re-engage both Stab Trim and Mach Trim. The FMS CDU repeatedly displayed 'FMS-FMS N1 Disagree' in the scratchpad. While on radar vectors at 3;000 feet MSL a GPWS 'Too Low Terrain' warning occurred and then ceased. Since we were on radar vectors and between layers with good visibility no action was taken. We were then cleared for the approach with the autopilot engaged. Flight Mode Annunciator captured both the Localizer and Glide slope. Just before the HSI CDI centered; the CDI began moving very rapidly and erratically. I disengaged the autopilot and corrected toward the CDI. There was no reaction by the CDI since they were moving erratically. I elected to go around. Once again on radar vectors we both made comments to each other about the way the instruments behaved. We requested an RNAV approach. We set the RNAV approach in the FMS and prepared for another approach. This time we were past the FAF and descending; above our MDA; when the flight instruments began the same erratic behavior. I again started another missed approach and at the same time received an altitude warning from the Approach Controller. I asked for an airport with VFR weather to make a visual approach. We did not trust our flight instruments.  We diverted to [a suitable airport]. It was this approach where the altitude deviation occurred.  Turning inbound I descended a couple of hundred feet from the 2;100 foot floor. We corrected and landed without further difficulty. On taxi to parking the nose wheel steering failed as I was being marshaled to a stop. The altitude deviation was the result of hurrying to get the plane on the ground. In retrospect; we should have been very deliberate and cautious given the problems we encountered that day; we had plenty of fuel. With the high stress levels we had; CRM would have helped us avoid needless pitfalls.", {"entities": [[972, 982, "WEATHER"], [1854, 1861, "WEATHER"], [190, 193, "ABBREVIATION"], [218, 224, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [262, 273, "CREW"], [488, 491, "ABBREVIATION"], [581, 584, "ABBREVIATION"], [637, 645, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [742, 745, "ABBREVIATION"], [772, 775, "ABBREVIATION"], [776, 779, "ABBREVIATION"], [838, 848, "ALTITUDE"], [849, 852, "ABBREVIATION"], [1033, 1041, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1051, 1060, "AIRPLANE"], [1155, 1158, "ABBREVIATION"], [1159, 1162, "ABBREVIATION"], [1177, 1180, "ABBREVIATION"], [1241, 1250, "AIRPLANE"], [1276, 1279, "ABBREVIATION"], [1310, 1313, "ABBREVIATION"], [1363, 1372, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1493, 1497, "ABBREVIATION"], [1498, 1506, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1519, 1523, "ABBREVIATION"], [1524, 1532, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1540, 1543, "ABBREVIATION"], [1569, 1577, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1726, 1741, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1801, 1809, "CREW"], [1810, 1820, "CREW"], [1850, 1853, "ABBREVIATION"], [1872, 1887, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1980, 1988, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2047, 2056, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2069, 2081, "ALTITUDE"], [2091, 2101, "ALTITUDE"], [2126, 2132, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2172, 2179, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2184, 2188, "AIRPLANE"], [2189, 2194, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["I'm writing this to make you aware of an incident that occurred in ZZZ MOA today. The incident occurred at approximately [time] while supporting [Government entity] operations in the southeast corner of the MOA. I was the pilot not flying in the right seat. We had two-way comms with the airspace controlling facility and had made them aware of our position; which they relayed to the other aircraft that entered the MOA. After being established in a 2 mile radius; right-hand orbit at 12;500 feet over that point for roughly 30 minutes; we observed a TCAS track that was approximately 7 miles away; 500 feet below; 2 to 3 o'clock; closing and climbing. I attempted to visually acquire the aircraft while Pilot Flying monitored the TCAS scope. The track became a traffic advisory at approximately 3 miles and 400 feet below; and within 2-3 seconds; a resolution advisory that directed us to not descend; then into an aural 'CLIMB CLIMB' alert. The Pilot Flying began a climb to comply with the RA at which point I visually acquired a single military fighter and we exchanged aircraft control. I reversed from the climb into an aggressive descent to avoid the fighter.  During that maneuver; Pilot Not Flying visually acquired the fighter as it passed over us (my estimate is within 200 feet). The belly of the aircraft was all we could see; so no tail flash was observed. TCAS indicated a two-ship after this; but we only visually acquired one. It's possible that the RA was generated by the other aircraft (if it was below us); or that their close in low to high maneuver prevented the TCAS from computing a proper escape maneuver.

We were on Taxiway SC and had stopped short of Taxiway RA when we switched over to the Ramp Frequency. We were told by the ramp Controller we had caused a safety issue by almost cutting off traffic. The nearest aircraft to us was on RB; two taxiways away from us. We informed ramp we were cleared to follow Aircraft Y on SC and to switch to ramp. Ramp was mid radio call when we switched over. We waited for that radio call to complete and checked in. The Ramp Controller's radio call was something to the effect of 'what are you doing?' We informed him we were on SC short of RA following Aircraft Y. Ramp informed us that we had 'created a safety concern with traffic we were nose to nose with and there was no Aircraft Y we were following.' There was no nose to nose traffic and Aircraft Y chimed in with their call sign and the fact that it was them we were behind. Aircraft Y had turned right; but we needed a left turn. The Captain informed Ramp that there was no aircraft we were near and no safety issue present. Ramp again informed us that we had created a safety issue and that 'No further discussion [was] required.' He then cleared us to taxi via RA to RB to parking and switch to the other ramp. At no point was there a safety issue to us or any other aircraft. The closest we were to any aircraft was three lengths away. Or more; or two taxiways away.

Upon checking in with Tower; we were told to switch runway assignment back to Runway 18R. With the Captain's consent I replied 'unable.' We were asked why we couldn't switch. I replied 'operational restriction. We can't switch runway assignments this low to the ground [1;500 [feet AGL] by my recollection) without the risk of the aircraft notifying the company of some deviation.' While not explicitly saying so in my statement; I was referencing our SMS (Safety Management) and FOQA (Quality Assurance) parameters. I am aware FOQA sets the standard at 1;000 [feet AGL]; but neither the Captain or I want to risk a deviation while reloading the FMS. The Tower told us to continue. We continued our configuration of the aircraft and we were eventually given clearance to land 18L. We were told to clear the runway and join Taxiway F southbound and to remain with Tower. At the southern end of Taxiway F we were told to copy a phone number and call the Tower upon reaching the gate.The Captain made the phone call at the gate and while I was only aware of his half of the conversation; it seems that the Tower's position is that in VFR conditions:1. Side steps are to be complied with immediately; even if inside the FAF.2. Statements of 'Unable' are not allowed.3. We can do these maneuvers without fear of safety violation.We have the AIM and Title 14 of the CFR. On top of that we have Manufacturer's POH. On top of that we have our manuals. We fly the top of that stack and we certainly don't fly generic passages in FAA JO 7110 without questioning how they might conflict with SMS. It is the position of both myself and the Captain; that my 'unable' should only have had two outcomes.1. Clearance to land and taxi to the gate without further harassment.2. Instructions to go-around and expect Runway 18R after the go-around procedure.Factors which may lead to unstable approaches include: Late clearances or runway changes. Right now I have no idea if there's a Controller in DFW Tower kicking this event up the chain to the FSDO so I receive certificate action.\nWe checked in with the first DFW Regional Controller while on the VKTRY STAR. We were assigned RWY 18R.  Shortly there after the same controller changed our runway assignment to Runway 18L and proceed direct UDALL. We were switched to the Final DFW Regional Controller. That Controller was asking other aircraft if they could switch back to Runway 18R. We were not asked to switch by the final DFW Regional Controller. As we neared UDALL we were assigned heading 150 and asked if we had DFW in sight. We complied with the heading clearance; called the field; and we were cleared for the Visual Approach 18L. This last instruction had us joining the localizer closer to FAF HASTY. HASTY is charted as 5 miles from the thresh hold.  We were told to contact Tower.Upon checking in with Tower; we were told to switch runway assignment back to Runway 18R. Since we were approaching the FAF to 18L I told the FO (First Officer) to tell the controller we are 'Unable.'  As a company and crew we have emphasized the importance of a stable approach and the leading causes of unstable approaches; the Controller's action would have led us toward a potentially unstable approach. We were asked why we couldn't switch.  The FO replied 'Operational restriction. We can't switch runway assignments this low to the ground [1;500 [feet AGL] by my recollection) without the risk of the aircraft notifying the company of some deviation.' I have been 'asked' on extended final if I could accept a transition to the parallel runway; but never just cleared to transition as we check in approaching the FAF. The Tower told us to continue. We continued our configuration of the aircraft and we were eventually given clearance to land 18L.  We were told to clear the runway and join Taxiway F southbound and to remain with Tower. At the southern end of Taxiway F we were told to copy a phone number and call the Tower upon reaching the gate.The Captain made the phone call at the gate and while I was only aware of his half of the conversation; it seems that the Tower's position is that in VFR conditions; side steps are to be complied with immediately; even if inside the FAF. Statements of 'Unable' are not allowed. We can do these maneuvers without fear of safety violation. After we secured the aircraft at the gate I called the Tower phone number; as directed; and spoke to an individual that stated he was observing our approach. I do not know if he was a Supervisor or a controller. He asked why we would not accept the transition and I stated we were approaching the FAF after being changed from 18R to 18L and now at the last minute the controller just clears us to transition back to 18R. To configure and change or remove the localizer frequency and update FMS sets us up for an unstable approach. The individual on the phone then stated we are the first aircraft that would not accept the clearance and that they do it all the time. He stated that it was approach that flipped us from 18R to 18L due to a runway inspection and now we are delaying his departures by not accepting the Controller's last minute change. He stated we are VFR and should not have any reason why we could not accept their clearance to transition to 18R as we check in with Tower approaching the FAF to 18L. The safety of the aircraft; passengers and crew are my responsibility; if we state 'unable' the controller could do the following: Ask our intentions; clear us to land or have us go around and set up for 18R.", {"entities": [[2630, 2638, "WEATHER"], [3899, 3907, "WEATHER"], [3983, 3991, "WEATHER"], [5600, 5608, "WEATHER"], [41, 51, "CREW"], [71, 75, "ABBREVIATION"], [94, 97, "ABBREVIATION"], [154, 160, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [255, 265, "CREW"], [404, 414, "CREW"], [591, 599, "CREW"], [655, 665, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [724, 733, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [759, 764, "CREW"], [788, 793, "CREW"], [818, 824, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [865, 872, "CREW"], [993, 999, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1042, 1047, "ALTITUDE"], [1048, 1051, "ABBREVIATION"], [1326, 1331, "ALTITUDE"], [1332, 1335, "ABBREVIATION"], [1354, 1361, "CREW"], [1412, 1415, "ABBREVIATION"], [1421, 1426, "CREW"], [1537, 1541, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1573, 1579, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1629, 1634, "CREW"], [1718, 1723, "CREW"], [1742, 1746, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1751, 1758, "CREW"], [1786, 1790, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1869, 1874, "CREW"], [1897, 1900, "ABBREVIATION"], [2169, 2172, "ABBREVIATION"], [2213, 2216, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2262, 2265, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2286, 2289, "ABBREVIATION"], [2394, 2401, "CREW"], [2470, 2474, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2491, 2495, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2542, 2551, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2584, 2593, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2639, 2649, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2678, 2684, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2732, 2742, "CREW"], [2750, 2755, "CREW"], [2875, 2885, "CREW"], [2905, 2909, "ABBREVIATION"], [2928, 2931, "ABBREVIATION"], [2990, 2996, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3091, 3101, "CREW"], [3108, 3118, "CREW"], [3240, 3250, "CREW"], [3427, 3435, "CREW"], [3588, 3593, "CREW"], [3616, 3621, "CREW"], [3646, 3652, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3698, 3709, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3736, 3738, "ABBREVIATION"], [3740, 3753, "CREW"], [3864, 3872, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3908, 3918, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3924, 3934, "CREW"], [3992, 4000, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4045, 4047, "ABBREVIATION"], [4098, 4104, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4147, 4152, "ALTITUDE"], [4153, 4156, "ABBREVIATION"], [4338, 4344, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4398, 4409, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4423, 4428, "CREW"], [4539, 4543, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4576, 4582, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4632, 4637, "CREW"], [4721, 4726, "CREW"], [4745, 4749, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4754, 4761, "CREW"], [4789, 4793, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4872, 4877, "CREW"], [4900, 4903, "ABBREVIATION"], [5125, 5129, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5143, 5148, "CREW"], [5236, 5244, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5369, 5380, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5578, 5581, "ABBREVIATION"], [5609, 5617, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5777, 5785, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5827, 5833, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5905, 5915, "CREW"], [5955, 5958, "ABBREVIATION"], [6071, 6076, "CREW"], [6077, 6088, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6268, 6272, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6284, 6293, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["Departure on this flight occurs well before the Control Tower opens. While preflighting; the aircraft received and printed a PDC with a clearance that deviated slightly from our filed plan. We inputted and cross-verified the clearance and the squawk code. This was the first time for both of us operating out of SJC as an uncontrolled field and we carefully reviewed and briefed the 10-9 and 10-7 for any pertinent information. I remember commenting that it was odd getting a PDC with the Tower closed and the Captain agreed that it was unusual. We made all necessary calls on CTAF as we pushed; taxied; and took off. When I called NorCal for the first time airborne; the Controller sounded confused; asked for an ident and told us to remain VFR; then told us to standby for our route clearance. I responded that we would stay VFR and that we had received clearance via PDC. He said they didn't have that capability; then read us pretty much the same clearance and same code. He instructed us in the future that we needed NorCal permission to depart IFR. At no time were we in IMC condition or near any other traffic. Challenging morning! This is a XA:XX scheduled departure that followed a minimum rest overnight. Preflight prep was a bit of a struggle. Neither of us could get flight view to work for some time until we utilized the hotspot; then could not get weather as the ASOS frequency only broadcast NOTAMs; until we figured out to call the number for the ASOS on the 10-7. We were both very familiar with SJC but neither had operated with ATC closed. We focused pretty hard on all the unusual stuff making sure we didn't miss obstacle procedure; noise abatement or a required runway but utterly missed the fact that the PDC did not apparently constitute an IFR clearance to depart. The PDC was 'normal' and did not contain a wheels up or any unusual instructions. Had we not received the PDC; we would naturally have contacted NorCal just like at the dozens of uncontrolled fields we go to; but for some reason having the PDC; along with everything else did not trigger that instinct that early in the morning. This should be a schedule red alert reminding pilots about operating outside ATC hours at this airport. I'm not sure where the PDC came from; but I can see this confusing a lot of people. Why one was generated at all is my biggest question.\nOn power up of aircraft at SJC; a PDC printed out and we entered this flight plan into the FMS. The Tower was closed and we commented to each other that it seemed odd that we got a PDC to begin with. We both looked very thoroughly through all of our documentation [10-7; 10-9; release notes and NOTAMs) for any information on this and only saw that the Aircraft X was exempt from the SJC curfew. We figured that this was our ATC clearance so we taxied out and took off from SJC and contacted NorCal Departure. NorCal told us to remain VFR and then gave us our clearance and squawk code which matched the PDC. It was VMC conditions and we told NorCal that since we received a PDC we thought we were cleared to depart SJC. He said that the departure facility did not have PDC capability and that next time we should contact them on the ground for our clearance and release. We then continued the flight with no more difficulties. This flight departed well before the Tower opened and we had a reduced rest over night the night before. Upon trying to initialize our iPads we were having trouble with the flight view program. It was not allowing either of us to enter the schedule to scan the Q codes. We turned on the portable WiFi device and this allowed us to initialize. This took extra time and we were already slightly fatigued from the prior nights short rest. The WX (weather) was also not being transmitted over the ATIS frequency. We called the AWOS phone number and got the one-minute WX. This seemed odd to us that the WX station was not broadcasting good information. All of these things seemed odd to us and were a cause for fatigue. There was also no guidance in any of our SJC information on contacting ATC for clearance even though we received a PDC. I've never been to an airport that I received a PDC before while the Tower was closed. Put in our company manuals and Jepp documents some information to contact ATC before departure even if you get a PDC. Had I not received a PDC I would have had to contact ATC to get my clearance and release. It was very confusing to have a PDC at a closed Tower facility. There should be a red exclamation mark on our schedules about departing SJC before the Tower is open while being issued a PDC.", {"entities": [[1363, 1370, "WEATHER"], [3733, 3740, "WEATHER"], [0, 9, "CREW"], [56, 61, "CREW"], [489, 494, "CREW"], [510, 517, "CREW"], [596, 602, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [608, 616, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [672, 682, "CREW"], [742, 745, "ABBREVIATION"], [827, 830, "ABBREVIATION"], [1043, 1049, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1050, 1053, "ABBREVIATION"], [1215, 1224, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1548, 1551, "CREW"], [1685, 1691, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1766, 1769, "ABBREVIATION"], [1783, 1789, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2166, 2172, "CREW"], [2197, 2200, "CREW"], [2452, 2455, "ABBREVIATION"], [2461, 2466, "CREW"], [2786, 2789, "CREW"], [2806, 2812, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2821, 2829, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2860, 2869, "CREW"], [2896, 2899, "ABBREVIATION"], [3070, 3076, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3301, 3309, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3326, 3331, "CREW"], [3782, 3786, "ABBREVIATION"], [4076, 4079, "CREW"], [4194, 4199, "CREW"], [4286, 4289, "CREW"], [4383, 4386, "CREW"], [4468, 4473, "CREW"], [4546, 4555, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4571, 4576, "CREW"]]}],

We were almost to Restricted Area and the pilot flying thought it was an immediately effective clearance and commanded a climb toward our desired altitude.

The pilot flying did not inform me that he had commanded a change to our altitude as is the procedure so that the other shelter knows what commands are being sent.

The pilot flying immediately commanded a descent back to the correct altitude.Approach passed a number to call and as the 'Mission Commander' I called.

We are both very sorry for the event and have reviewed our procedures both privately and with ALL of our fellow pilots at our weekly pilot meeting.

Ground Control stated to turn right onto Taxiway Charlie and taxi to the runway. Approaching the taxiway hold short line; Ground Control stated hurriedly '(our call sign) hold your position.' Our aircraft was quickly approaching the hold short line and I knew our four Flight Attendants were up in the cabin working hard and quickly to prepare the cabin for departure on this very short taxi. I did NOT slam on the brakes; yet did apply moderate braking to comply with Ground Control's directive. The aircraft was approximately nine feet over the striped line defining the border of the ramp and the taxiway.I keyed the microphone myself; or asked the First Officer to tell Ground Control (I do not remember which) that we were well over the taxiway line. There was a very rapidly approaching Company aircraft who was taxiing southeast on [the] taxiway for departure. Ground Control asked that Company if he could pass in front of us at the intersection. Company aircraft stated 'no problem.' Ground then advised us to hold our position and give way to Company. This was a big problem for us. The late directive from Ground control put us in a very precarious position. We were exposed and I felt we were in a position that could lead to a ground collision. The Company aircraft was traveling at a very high rate of speed and I was very uncomfortable. I knew that nothing was going to stop our Company. It was clear he was intent on somehow maneuvering around us. There was not time to advise ATC of our disagreement and work out 'Plan C.'  Instead of complying with Ground Control's clearance; I turned the aircraft full tiller to the right and initiated a 360 degree turn back onto the ramp; away from the speeding Company aircraft aimed directly at us. As I did so I keyed the microphone and stated 'Ground; we're not going to do that. We're turning to the right and will get in line with Company after our turn.'I stopped the aircraft after our turn and noticed that Company had maintained it's high speed. He was now approaching a left turn at the next taxiway. During the turn; Ground told us to taxi behind Company. I was very concerned and a little upset that ATC would both put us in that position and attempt to clear an aircraft around us when it should have been clear from our statement over Ground that we were well over the taxiway  ramp line.

If there is no change to his condition; to call STAT-MD back. I relayed this to the FAs and disconnected with STAT-MD.The three Doctors on board disagreed with STAT-MDs recommendation; and said we need to land; 'NOW'. I was 100 percent going to take the advise of Doctors ONBOARD over STAT-MD. I reconvened as the Pilot Flying; and we came to the decision to divert to ZZZ. Since the EMK (Emergency Medical Kit) would be used; and the landing would be overweight [145;300 pounds); Maintenance would need to be involved. A diversion plan was made by Dispatch; and we [advised ATC]. Center cleared us directly to ZZZZZ on the Arrival; landing west. Things got busy; real busy. I began an; expeditious; descent to get on the VNAV PATH. Only about 80 miles from ZZZ when we began our turn for the arrival. My FO picked up ATIS and ran the numbers for XXL and XXR; including a look at the Brake Cooling module. We then briefed the arrival and approach. As we got lower we kept getting turned in on the arrival; which I was okay with. I admit; I was a bit in the Yellow for awhile. We were below 10;000 ft. when we finally got around to running the Descent; Approach; and Diversion Checklists. I extended the gear early; to help lighten our weight by as much as I could. The approach was made to Runway XXR. The; soft; landing was uneventful. We taxied off the runway; and right into the ramp. The FO contacted Ramp; Ops; and Maintenance. Once in the gate; I left the seat belt sign on and made a PA to the Passengers to remain seated. The EMTs quickly deplaned the ill Passenger and left. As soon as the boarding door was open; the Parking Checklist complete; and I turned on my phone; I was barraged; to say the least. I called Dispatch and spoke with him; the Chief Pilot on Call; Ground Ops; and Maintenance. I didn't even have time to debrief with my Crew. Once I was able to talk to the FAs it was made aware to me that an IV had been administered to the ill Passenger. It ran out as we touched down. The FAs said the ill Passenger's condition IMMEDIATELY deteriorated again. Further justifying our decision to divert. I feel I made the best decision I could; considering the circumstance and utilized all necessary resources to reach the desired outcome. A job well done by my Cabin Crew; and my FO. I also think a stellar job was made by Ops and Maintenance to get the aircraft on its way again.", {"entities": [[3, 9, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [22, 31, "ALTITUDE"], [396, 398, "ABBREVIATION"], [400, 413, "CREW"], [588, 594, "ALTITUDE"], [935, 939, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1211, 1222, "CREW"], [1279, 1287, "CREW"], [1305, 1308, "CREW"], [1363, 1370, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1430, 1437, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1452, 1456, "ABBREVIATION"], [1535, 1537, "ABBREVIATION"], [1548, 1552, "ABBREVIATION"], [1668, 1676, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1820, 1829, "ALTITUDE"], [1882, 1890, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1999, 2007, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2070, 2076, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2085, 2091, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2112, 2116, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2122, 2124, "ABBREVIATION"], [2150, 2161, "CREW"], [2175, 2179, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2192, 2196, "AIRPLANE"], [2221, 2223, "ABBREVIATION"], [2338, 2342, "AIRPLANE"], [2454, 2462, "CREW"], [2508, 2514, "CREW"], [2524, 2535, "CREW"], [3027, 3029, "ABBREVIATION"], [3078, 3089, "CREW"]]}],

	["Runway 28L has a significant downslope in the touchdown zone that is not addressed in the 10-7 documentation or on the associated approach charts. The documentation notes that when landing Runway 10R the upslope at the far end of the runway can give the illusion of being high. There is no mention of the illusion when landing Runway 28L. The downslope is almost entirely within the 28L landing zone; where the runway drops 55 feet. The effect on the flare at 5-10 feet is not unlike a ski jump hill; where the ground continually falls away as the aircraft attempts to settle; extending the glide prior to touchdown. Additionally the winds were robust and gusting out of the northwest on this particular day. This added the additional difficulty as the wind burbled over the airport structures then blew up the slope on the north side of the landing zone; further exacerbating the floating tendency. There should be a note on all Jepp pages associated with Runway 28L that the runway has a significant downslope in the touchdown zone which can lead to significant float. Additionally; upslope winds from either side of the runway due to its elevated nature can cause updrafts in the landing area when crosswinds are present. On my landing we crossed the threshold at 50 feet and I was just able to touch down prior to the end of the touchdown zone. We watched a B737 landing behind us float a significant distance 5 feet above the downslope and that aircraft executed a missed approach. I personally had never previously landed on Runway 28L and was not aware of any issue with the runway.

	["Our airplane was dispatched with MEL 34-XX-XX FMS Nav Database Out of Date. I didn't realize until during my preflight that we were filed an RNAV departure. The previously mentioned MEL precludes any RNAV procedures in the terminal area. I contacted our Dispatcher and he coordinated for a new CPDLC departure clearance which included the ZZZZZ SID--see attached photo for the exact wording. The departure clearance also included a LOAD REVIEW prompt (see attached photo); which I selected and then selected LOAD ACT. At this point the active flight plan had ZZZ XXR on line one; ZZZZZ1 on line two and ZZZ1 on line three with no DISCON's. Fast forward to the takeoff position runway XXR; our takeoff clearance was heading 270deg; climb & maintain 5000. Once airborne we received a couple headings with the final heading being 010 deg to join the ZZZZZ1 transition. The FO entered ZZZon the NAV RAD page and armed the VOR. The airplane intercepted the radial and flew it outbound. At ZZZZZ1 the FMS transitioned to heading mode. That seemed to be the correct thing to do because the wording in the ROUTING box of the SID read; 'Crossing the transition fix; continue on current heading; EXPECT vectors from ZZZ Center to join filed route.' We requested direct ZZZ1 from the low sector controller who handed us off to the high sector controller for that request. That controller seemed a bit confounded by our request but he did clear us direct ZZZ1. A few minutes later he asked us if we had time for a question. During the ensuing conversation he stated that ATC understood our flight to be cleared and expected us to fly direct ZZZ1 after ZZZZZ1. He said he (and his colleagues) had no knowledge of the verbiage I mentioned earlier about continuing on current heading.Cause: In retrospect; I believe the confusion was generally caused because we were transitioning from a traditional NAVAID departure to an RNAV enroute routing. Specifically; numerous after-the-fact rereads made me realize that the wording and format of our second CPDLC clearance was anything but clear.Suggestions: A clearer; more straightforward clearance could have helped alleviate some confusion. Additionally; filing for radar vectors rather a traditional SID on departure would probably be the best course of action when an airplane is not legal to fly RNAV procedures in the terminal area.\nWe were scheduled to fly airplane [tail number]. This airplane had MEL 34-XX-XX FMS NAV database out of date. This Mel does not allow for the use of RNAV SIDS. We were filed on an RNAV Sid. We didn't catch this until we were at the airplane. We called our Dispatcher and they refilled us on the ZZZZZ. We also received a new clearance via CPDLC. I have attached a copy of the clearance. After takeoff we were given 'turn to heading 010 and join the ZZZZZ1 Transition '. We tuned the vor and intercepted the course to ZZZZZ1 on the Jeppesen plate for the ZZZZZ under the Routing section it says 'expect vectors to join assigned transition fix; continue on current heading; expect vectors from ZZZ Center to join filed route.' As we got closer to ZZZZZ1 and hadn't gotten any instruction we ask center for direct ZZZ1. The controller said he cannot give us direct and to contact the next controller. By the time we got ahold of the next controller we were past ZZZZZ1 on our previous heading. We asked for direct to ZZZ1. We were given it. A minute later the controller asked if we had time for a question. We had a quick discussion and he said that they were expecting us to have turned at ZZZZZ1 to ZZZ1. We told them about what the routing box on the Jepp plate said and they were unaware of that verbage. Cause: I believe that the late change to a NON RNAV sid they we don't normally do. Along with the verbiage In the Routing box on the Jepp plate; and the CPDLC clearance with a change led to us being confused about what to do after the fix ZZZZZ1.

Just outside of the final approach fix we were advised of and saw traffic on our TCAS below our altitude coming at us. On the descent on the established final the traffic gave us a TA and continued towards us followed by an RA AT OUR ALTITUDE advising us to 'descend descend descend now'.

	["Assigned a heading; we were told to expect the Visual Approach to RWY 24 into TTN. Tonight we were being vectored and I noticed we were on a downwind; but we were further south of what would be a standard left traffic pattern. About midfield left downwind; we advised ATC we had the field in sight. After a short period of time we were issue a vector of 010 and cleared the Visual 24. I noticed that a vector of 010 would have us turning base to final at what I estimated to be a 2.5 mile final with the aircraft setup for a 129 degree intercept. We continued to descend and level off at a 1000' in order to fully configure and complete checks. After level off; we received a low altitude alert from TTN Tower. We were approximately 3 NM from the extended centerline of RWY 24. We turned base to final at 1000' white over white on the PAPI. We were stabilized; acquired normal glide path at about 2.0 NM. What occurred was not unsafe. However; a normal traffic pattern which I have flown many times into this same airport would have eliminated any guess work and we wouldn't have received the low altitude alert from Tower. During a normal visual pattern approach; I can discern distance from the runway off the wing and appropriate altitude in relation to the runway visually. An overlay extended centerline is used only to confirm the correct RWY. With a vector to a visual at that kind of intercept angle; while I can see the airport; you're forcing crews to estimate where altitude should be in space by referencing the overlay extended centerline relative to a 3 degree glide path; requiring our heads to be down. The vector we were given tonight required us to turn final less than 3 miles from the runway; requiring us to be fully configured and at approach speed [135KIAS) prior to making the base to final turn. During vector to visual approaches; I recommend that ATC communicate what distance the vector to final will achieve from the runway. Additionally; altitude guidance should be given with vector angles less than 90 degrees from the intended runway.  I interpret 'cleared the visual approach' to mean I am free to maneuver so as to conduct a normal stabilized approach by visual reference to the runway while honoring published approach profiles. That's precisely what we did tonight and we got an altitude alert from TTN Tower. What I can do differently in the future to prevent future occurrence is to use the CAT D published circling altitude if there is an IAP to serve as a better way to plan our descent near the airport. In this instance; I was thinking visual approach during the approach; but I could have very easily drawn a 3.6 NM circle around Runway 24 and used that as a reference as well.

	["While preparing to depart; the ramp agents notified us that they could not attach the tow bar to the airplane. Upon inspection we determined that was indeed the case. Since the airplane had just flown in prior we made the assumption that it wasn't of concern and at the suggestion of the ramp agents; we decided to make a turn out of the parking spot instead of pushing back. The flight continued with no further issues. Upon arrival at our destination; we contacted Maintenance to take a look just to be sure. Their assessment of the aircraft alerted us to missing parts on the nose gear leaving the aircraft right nose wheel to be held on by a hand-tight castlated nut instead of being backed up with two bolts and safety wire.After discussion with the Mechanics at our arrival station; my belief is that the aircraft left a previous maintenance action with the parts missing and the aircraft was operated for multiple flights in that condition. Due to the prevalence of pushback equipment that doesn't require a tow bar; it would be easy for that to be missed until the next time a tow bar was to be used. Additionally; as pilots; we are trained to trust that an aircraft is airworthy when it leaves Maintenance and the purpose of our preflight inspection is to verify the 'big picture' airworthiness of the aircraft. We are not trained to know every nut and bolt on the airplane which would make an issue like this an understandable oversight on the part of any flight crew associated with the aircraft.A more detailed assurance check of aircraft leaving Maintenance and/or a more detailed means of tracking parts removed vs. parts installed would assure that an aircraft is not returned to service in an unairworthy condition.\nJust prior to departure the ramp crew notified the Captain that the tow bar would not properly attach to the nose wheel.

Due to the majority of the push backs being accomplished without the need of a tow bar it would be easy for that to be missed until the need for a tow bar is required.

Approximately 5 to 10 minutes prior to the incident the jet was experiencing continuous light chop due to cloud tops. Seat belt sign was illuminated and PA was made. Pilot Monitoring contacted ATC for rides higher when the turbulence was encountered. The Pilot Flying recovered from the unusual attitude. The aircraft experienced bank angles in excess of 50 degrees both directions and the Autopilot disengaged due to the bank angles. Loss of airspeed in excess of 30 to 40 knots also occurred. Pilot Flying applied max power firewall. Barber poles came together however no over speed or under speed clacker. Aircraft lost at least 500 feet and recovered with no excessive force to aircraft. After recovery Pilot Monitoring requested an immediate climb due to the turbulence up to 36;000 feet and was given an immediate climb to 33;000 feet. ATC gave a frequency change with the climb clearance and the next sector gave the continuation climb clearance to 36000 feet. Pilot Monitoring called the cabin immediately after the recovery was stabilized. Flight Attendant A and B and Flight Attendant D were thrown around and sustained minor injuries in the aft galley. Two passengers that were up near the aft lavatories also sustained minor injuries. MED LINK and PARAMEDICS were denied by both passengers. Passenger standing outside the lavatory fell into the lavatory door breaking the door off the hinges which then fell onto the passenger inside the lavatory. The Pilot Monitoring briefed the passengers over PA and contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control. The Captain and First Officer conducted a post flight briefing with Flight Attendants along with a post flight debrief with Flight Attendant Supervisor. The Flight Attendant crew was shook up and felt the aftermath after landing. It is pertinent in situations like these 'emergencies' that the crews are taken well care of by the company regardless of the CBA (Cost Benefit Analysis); policies and procedures. Let's do the right thing for them. During upset recovery the aircraft lost at least 500 feet. This is an approximate guess by the pilots since the loss of airspeed and power at firewall along with excessive bank angles were in the primary scan. ATC gave an immediate climb clearance and the crew complied. No further actions taken. Our route was filed north to stay out of the jet stream for turbulence avoidance. However it is good practice to keep in mind that the Rockies can be unforgiving even when Dispatch tools; WSI (Weather Briefer); ATC and other aircraft are not reporting any anomalies. Maybe the Flight Attendant as a precautionary effort turn the seat belt sign on with a quick PA while crossing over the Rockies as we have posted before. Lesson learned.

As I described in the logbook write up; EGT was surging from approximately 610 to 740 degrees with only CLB 2 set. Some surges were quite rapid and approached the amber band. We intervened by reducing power to prevent any engine exceedances. All other engine gauges were also surging in sync including fuel flow; which was surging 500-600 pph. There was no excessive vibrations or unusual noises. I pushed the Event Record during one surge.We requested ATC clearance to level off and run the QRH procedure. Also; with the power reduced on the right engine; we were probably not going to be capable of reaching our cruise altitude. We accomplished the Rolls Royce Engine Fluctuations procedure; which led us into the Engine Surge procedure. This did not stop the surges.My First Officer and I agreed a diversion was the safest course of action. At this point we had time to call Dispatch and [Maintenance] and informed them of our situation and my intent to [request priority handling] and divert to ZZZ; which was passing off to our right. Also; weather was good there and it met the considerations in the FOM Diversion Guide. They concurred.We diverted since we had an engine that was degraded and probably not capable of providing full power and had to be monitored to avoid exceeding any limits. I hit the Divert key on ACARS; requested non-normal landing data. Since; per the checklist and good judgement; the engine may not be able to provide go-around thrust; or may even fail prior to arrival; we set up and accomplished a single engine landing profile.

Pilot Monitoring contacted ATC for rides above; at about that time the airspeed began to show a decreasing trend and the Pilot Flying added power to adjust; airspeed continued to decrease and the Pilot Flying added even more power. At about that time the turbulence started and the right wing dropped and aircraft bank angles showed in excess of 50 degrees kicking off autopilot. Airspeed loss was an excess of 30-40 kts. whereby Pilot Flying applied max power. Barber poles came together however no overspeed or stall warning occurred.

After recovery Pilot Monitoring requested an immediate climb due to Moderate to Severe turbulence up to 36000 ft. and was given 33000 ft. ATC gave us a frequency change and got an immediate climb to 36000 ft.; with no further incident.  During upset recovery aircraft lost at least 500 ft. This is an approximate guess by the pilots since the loss of airspeed and power at firewall along with excessive bank angles were in the primary scan. ATC gave an immediate climb clearance and crew complied. No further action was taken.

	["While boarding the flight; FA (Flight Attendant) A notified me that a passenger stated that he had lithium batteries in his carry-on bag; but that the bag wouldn't fit in the overhead bin; and so the passenger had decided to place the bag on the planeside baggage cart.  The FA was concerned that the passenger was going to place a bag with lithium batteries in the cargo compartment; so she asked me to talk to the passenger.  I approached the passenger and asked him if he had lithium batteries in his bag (which turned out to be a hard-sided case) and he responded that he had lithium batteries installed in cameras inside the case.  He did not want to place the item on the cart because they were expensive.  I asked a nearby ramp agent to request a supervisor.  A man approached and when I asked him if he was a supervisor; he responded yes.  We explained the situation to him; and the supervisor said that as long as the lithium batteries were installed inside a camera; laptop; or phone; and not loose in a bag; that the bag could be checked into a cargo bin.  This was something I was unsure of; but he said this very confidently; and since we have no guidance in our FOM (Operating Manual) about lithium batteries; I complied with what the supervisor said and the ramp placed the bag into the forward cargo bin.  After the flight; FA A said that she had been audited on the flight by inflight management; and when she asked them about the incident; they said that no lithium batteries at all can be in cargo bins. We need to have some kind of guidance on lithium batteries in our FOM to help us in situations like these.  I do not know if the bag should have been in the cargo bin or not.  After the flight; I still could find no guidance on this issue at all on the training app.\nWhile boarding passengers; a flight attendant came up to the cockpit and informed us that their was a passenger with lithium batteries in his carry on and that he was unable to stow it in the cabin. He was unwilling to remove the batteries and tried to place it on the ala cart; though lithium batteries are apparently not allowed in aft baggage. The Captain; discussed with several ramp agents was told that it was fine to stow the bag in forward cargo with the lithium batteries inside. After landing in ZZZ1; we were subsequently informed by an inflight auditor that lithium batteries aren't allowed in forward cargo. There seems to be a definite lack of guidance in our manuals about the carriage of lithium batteries.

	["During a Cross Country solo training flight in a Cessna 172SP; I was involved in a situation that resulted in a near mid-air collision with a U.S. Air Force Aircraft Y cargo plane. It should be noted that the bulk of my aviation experience comes from flying helicopters. The majority of my flight experience has occurred in the Northeast region of the United States. On this particular day; just prior to the event in question; I felt very comfortable in the mode of flight I was operating in. I have been attending a full-time part 141 school to 'transition' to fixed wing flying for the past two months. During this time I have logged over 100 hours of flying time in the same type of aircraft I was flying; in the same region the incident occurred. At the time of the incident; I was in the last 20 minutes of an approximately three hour flight. I was flight following with Approach Control when I heard the controller mention my tail number followed by a transmission I did not understand. I asked the controller to 'say again'. The next transmission I heard alerted me to traffic at my 9 o'clock. When I looked out the left window of my aircraft I witnessed an Aircraft Y; less than one mile from me; rapidly descending out of my altitude. I immediately initiated a climb. I informed the controller that the Aircraft Y was passing below me. I then heard the Aircraft Y pilot mention that his RA had alerted him to my position. Had it not been for the quick actions of the pilot of the Aircraft Y; I believe we would have been on a direct collision course with one another. I was complacent in the fact that I expected ATC to give me pertinent advisories; knowing full well that while flying VFR those advisories come on a work-load permitting basis. This situation could have easily ended in disaster had it not been for the last minute advisory I got from ATC; combined with the quick actions of the Aircraft Y pilot.

	["We were flying our third leg of the day. We had multiple MEL's on the aircraft one of which was deferred left pack that we deferred. We pushed and then had a gate return for an associated maintenance item that had to be addressed that popped up after we left the gate. After a quick visit from maintenance personnel we pushed. We took off without any issues. During climb out around 18;000 feet our right pack (the only operational pack on the aircraft) did an uncommanded shutdown. We had no EICAS cautions or warnings when the pack shut down we simply got an R Pack Off status message. The cabin was now not being pressurized and the cabin altitude was rising. I called for our immediate action items for a CABIN ALT/ EMER DESCENT. At that point we [notified ATC] and performed our emergency descent. No passenger oxygen masks deployed during this event. We ran all check lists and got all pertinent airport data for [diversion airport] and landed without issue. I detected the malfunction in flight prior to any of the cabin altitude cautions or warnings. The left pack had shut down by itself during our taxi in to the gate. We attempted to trouble shoot the problem with Maintenance to no avail and we deferred the left pack. We pushed off the gate for our flight back and during taxi out after we started the left engine we got an intermittent left pack HI TEMP caution message. We called Maintenance who advised us to return to the gate. We did that and Maintenance came out and performed the required work and signed the aircraft off. We deplaned the passengers and had ground air conditioning hooked up to the aircraft due to the high cabin temperature. We then pushed back and departed without any issues. During climb out we were being pressurized off the right engine bleed and had a successful swap of bleed air from the APU. While climbing up to 25;000 feet around 18;000 feet we encountered icing conditions and turned on the cowl anti-ice system. I checked the ECS (Environmental Control System) page after we turned it on and had no issues. Shortly after that I felt a sudden stop of air from the cooling vents in the flight deck. I immediately looked at EICAS and saw an R Pack Off Status message. I went to the ECS page and our right pack was colored white and off. I immediately tried to cycle the pack. It did not restart. We at no time got an over pressure or over temperature caution/warning on EICAS. We were now not being pressurized and the cabin altitude was increasing. We did our immediate action items for a CABIN ALT/EMER DESCENT; declared and emergency and executed our descent to 8;000 feet. The First Officer called the flight attendant to give him the [checklist] items. We finished all of our checklists at 8;000 feet while being vectored by ATC. We got ATIS; performance data and briefings done and were vectored for the approach and landed without issue and taxied to our gate where we deplaned. I cycled the PACK and that did not work. I commanded the CABIN ALT/EMER DESCENT immediate action items and the associated checklist. We began our emergency descent to an ATC assigned altitude of 8;000 feet. The cabin altitude reached 10;000 feet as we descended thru 10;000 feet. We finished our checklists once we leveled off at 8;000 feet. We went O2 Masks off and finished the non immediate action items portion of the check list. We got landing data; ATIS; and pertinent information for an ILS and landed without issue. Don't allow single PACK 200's to operate revenue flights.\nThe crew was flying its third leg of the day with multiple MELs on the aircraft. Among the MELs was a deferred left PACK; so we were single pack at takeoff and throughout the climb to FL250. During climb out; just after climbing through 18;000 feet; we lost the one remaining (right) PACK; causing pressurization in the aircraft to begin decreasing (Cabin altitude began climbing quickly). We executed an emergency descent procedure; [notified ATC]; and diverted. We lost the left PACK during taxi to the gate. The Captain wrote up the aircraft; and Maintenance had us defer the Left PACK. We did so; loaded up and pushed back for takeoff; but during the taxi; and after the number 1 engine was started; we began getting an intermittent LEFT PACK OVERHEAT caution message with the associated master caution chime. We asked Tower to hold and the Captain contacted Maintenance. Maintenance told us to return to gate. By this point the aircraft had become very warm due to the single PACK operations. We elected to deplane the passengers and get external low pressure air hooked up to cool the aircraft while Maintenance came onboard; performed their maintenance actions; and signed off the maintenance can. After the cabin was cooled; we reloaded; pushed back; and went on our way single PACK. As we climbed through about 18;500 feet; we saw weather off the nose; and turned on the cowl heat (wings on; cowls on; wings off). The Captain went to the ICE and the ECS page to see that everything was working correctly. He noticed that the right PACK was no longer on. The Captain cycled the PACK; and it did not come back on. He commanded the emergency descent procedure; and we both donned our masks. I established comms; and told ATC that we were descending to 10;000 feet. I pulled out the QRH; and started through the non-memory immediate actions. After descending through 10;000 feet; we doffed our O2 masks and went through the rest (non-immediate action-items) in chapter 5 of the checklist. We triple chimed the Flight Attendant and went through the [checklist] items; and we asked ATC for radar vectors to the nearest airport. We diverted to [diversion airport]. We made a max weight landing [47;000) with no injuries to passengers; aircrew; or damage to the aircraft. Single PACK operations have an increased operational risk.

The Lead Ramp Agent was in the proper position at the front of the aircraft in full view. The jet bridge was moving towards the aircraft and was approximately 1-2 ft. from docking when the aircraft began shaking violently.

After the engine spooled down the after-landing checklist was completed. I went down to the ramp to investigate the cause of the vibration. The ground air conditioning hose which was secured to the jet bridge had been sucked into the engine. An examination of the engine revealed remnants of the yellow air conditioning hose in the engine bypass duct and core. I asked the ramp agents what they saw and was told the air conditioning hose was not properly latched. Therefore; as the jet bridge moved closer to the aircraft; the engine suction unfurled the hose leading to its ingestion.\nRevert back to starting the APU prior to parking at the gate so engine shutdown can be complete prior to ground handling movement.

	["Aircraft X was released for departure off of JAC airport via the GEYSER Departure Procedure. The aircraft departed Runway 01 at JAC and reported on frequency. I radar identified Aircraft X 2 miles north of JAC and asked the pilot to confirm his altitude. I gave a control instruction to the pilot; leaving 14;000 feet MSL cleared right turn direct a fix south of Aircraft X's position. The pilot read back the clearance correctly. Continuing my scan I began to ship another Aircraft to ZDV and while doing so noticed a radar hit showing a right turn of Aircraft X at about 10;200 feet MSL. The minimum IFR altitude in that area was just over 11;000 feet MSL. The departure procedure requires a right turn to intercept the outbound course from the JAC VOR. At times a quick turn by an aircraft is translated as a bigger turn by the radar system; therefore I couldn't tell initially if that turn was due to the aircraft or the radar. I finished shipping the aircraft to ZDV and watched Aircraft X for the second radar return. The second radar return showed a continuation of the right turn southbound. I immediately restated the clearance to not turn on course until leaving 14;000 feet MSL. The pilot again responded with the correct clearance given. I informed my manager of what was happening while I continued to monitor the aircraft's climb rate. Aircraft X had a climb rate that was fast enough to stay out of high terrain so no low altitude alert was issued. The manager left and I then shipped Aircraft X to the next sector in ZLC after a handoff was accepted. Sector 08 received Aircraft X and continued their climb. The data block was dropped leaving R16's airspace. The response by the pilot was that the fix NALSI is a fly by point instead of a fly over fix. The FMS of the Aircraft X is being stated as the reason for the early turn. I have never witnessed an FMS system make a 'smart turn' 10 miles from a fix to stay on course. Not all aircraft make that early of a turn including Aircraft X flown by company to many destinations from JAC.

Wires were particularly frayed on outside of bundles (perhaps rubbing internal frame) and around the zip tie wraps containing the bundles. While I was present the Mechanic removed nearby panels for SELCALL panel and the ignition/starter/wiper control panels and bare copper wire areas with eroded wire insulation was found again on multiple wire bundles.

Again for clarification I would like to stress these were not wires on individual components; but wires from aircraft electrical system to the cannon plugs feeding the components.

	["We departed the maintenance hangar in on a reposition flight under IFR conditions with light snow falling. We taxied to the deice pad and had them spray us with type 1 and 4 full body. After deice; we completed the Ice Test A with no defects or abnormal messages. It was the first flight for this aircraft; as well as being prudent when taking an aircraft from Maintenance. We took off shortly after with the aircraft configured for icing conditions. The takeoff was normal and the climb out was normal. As the First Officer (another CA (Captain)) was finishing his after-takeoff flow and checklist; we were already in icing conditions and were presented with Wing and Stab Anti Ice Fail and subsequently Ice Cond Anti-Ice INOP. I ensured that he had put the Ice override switch back to the AUTO position; which he had done successfully. We got out the QRH and the First Officer began reading it. We followed the guidance which ended up not solving our issue. Now climbing through 8000 ft. we collectively decided that continuing would not be prudent since we did not know how much ice the aircraft had accumulated or how much more we may encounter. We asked TRACON for a heading and altitude for a return to the airport. They gave us a right turn for a downwind and to descend to 5000 ft. Upon reaching 5000 ft. (Mod Ice reported below 5000 ft.) we noticed that the icing was worse than it had been; so we asked for 6000 ft. and were granted it immediately; where we spent the majority of the downwind leg. We set up for the ILS and briefed the approach quickly knowing the aircraft was picking up ice. We also notified Dispatch. ATC cleared us for the approach and I elected to hand fly to see how the aircraft felt. From the base turn it was apparent that the ice was affecting the flight controls adversely and more power was required.At this time the First Officer and I both agreed [advising ATC] would be prudent to ensure we got on the ground with priority. We completed the ILS Approach and landed safely. During the approach larger than normal control movements were required to keep the aircraft stable in moderate turbulence. We guessed it was because the ailerons were being affected by the ice on the leading edge disturbing the airflow. We taxied the aircraft back to the hangar with no further issues in the flight. After we had parked the aircraft and worked with maintenance to identify the problem we called scheduling to see what their plans were for us and made it clear that after an event like this that we were not willing to fly again and should receive rest. I have learned from previous [events] that adrenaline is powerful and the mental state after an [event] is not conducive to operating an aircraft safely. Scheduling wanted us to wait to see if maintenance could fix the problem and take the aircraft back into moderate icing conditions on to ZZZ after that. I told them that I was unwilling to accept the flight; to which they responded by giving me a 'refusal.' We were then released to rest.I think the First Officer (CA in FO (First Officer) seat); did a wonderful job of running the QRH and questioning system logic throughout the event. We both used our extensive system knowledge to try and troubleshoot the issue while reading the QRH. I don't know what caused the system to fail but failures are part of our industry and that is why we train. The crew performed excellently and followed procedure; and had excellent and professional help from Approach; for a safe outcome. Good CRM; good TEM (Threat and Error Management); good training. My biggest concern was scheduling's response to our fitness for duty and asking us to fly again after a successful [event] landing. I do NOT think it is safe or fair of them to ask pilots to fly after such events. Even more so; pilots should not be penalized for performing their duty and saving an aircraft and passengers; only to be met by a refusal to fly on their schedules. We kept saying; ' We are donefor the day; one [event] is enough.' I understand not all situations are equal but this needs to be addressed.\nFerry of an aircraft.

The CSA (Customer Service Associate); who was waiting at the R1 door; then said 'you gave the caters a thumbs up when they knocked and the strapped was attached' which I do not recall doing. D Flight Attendant didn't see the warning strap in the armed position when she boarded the plane either. I immediately moved the warning strap to the disarmed position and noticed that the velcro strap on the extension piece was worn out to the point where the extension would not stay attached. It constantly fell down and hung.I told the First Officer as she was leaving the flight deck that we had an issue with the R1 warning strap. She indicated that they were about to time out and discounted my comment. I made her look at the strap. She came to the door and said 'no; it works; see'. I showed her that 4/5 attempts to place the strap on the Velcro didn't work; it would fall down. She said 'well you gotta talk to the Captain about it' and then entered the bathroom. I then proceeded to talk to the Captain. He stopped me before I even started and said 'if you tell me anything I am obligated to put it in the book; so is this really important?' I said yes; I have an issue with the warning strap. He also indicated that they had a timing issue and couldn't take any delays. I told them that I needed Maintenance. Maintenance came and fixed the strap. I don't know what happened with the strap being across the window in the armed position. I can only speculate that catering attached it while it was hanging down.

I replied that I thought I had intercepted it; but something did not seem right and requested to fly the missed approach. I was then asked to change frequencies back to Approach Control. I was given a heading and was leveling off. I then turned the heading bug and turned off the GPSS function on the autopilot.

At some point I realized that I was in what I thought was an unusual attitude; and maneuvered to level the wings and raise the nose to stop the descent. Still not knowing why or how the autopilot turned off. Approach then contacted me about my heading and altitude which resulted in my focusing on whether the autopilot was on or not and; another pitch up and slight bank occurred.

	["The sky was clear and the sun was low and bright as I approached F51 from the southwest for planned fuel stop. It had rained significantly the night before with standing water visible in fields in the area. The airport appeared to have a wide water-soaked grass/dirt strip parallel what I mistook to be a narrow blacktop runway. I circled the airport to observe the windsock and noted that the winds were out of the NW favoring Runway 1. There were no visible runway markings other than a narrow white line on the blacktop. The approach to landing was high; so I initiated a slip to steepen my descent. Touchdown was bit long but otherwise uneventful. It wasn't until I started braking that I realized I had landed on the taxiway parallel to Runway 1. After landing I continued to taxi to the fuel pumps and shut down. Upon exiting the aircraft; I walked to the end of Runway 19 to look for any markings and found very faded stripping and numbers that were nearly invisible on the wet hard surface. The wet surface appeared quite brown vs black. Following fueling; I taxied on parallel taxiway to the end of Runway 1 where I again observed very faint and hard to distinguish markings on the wet surface. Takeoff and departure on Runway 1 was normal. In reviewing this unintended landing on a taxiway; I believe the following were contributing factors:1) unfamiliarity with this airport2) higher than normal approach with slip to landing was distracting my full attention to the landing surface3) Rain soaked surface of Runway 1 make it look like wet grass or dirt4) The wet Runway 1 markings were not clearly visible...needs repainting5) The blacktop of taxiway with its white centerline stripe appeared to look like a narrow runway with wide grass/dirt strip next to it.", {"entities": [[54, 64, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [256, 261, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [321, 327, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [460, 466, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [467, 475, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [528, 536, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [594, 601, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [708, 714, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [722, 729, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [758, 765, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [781, 785, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [895, 903, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1067, 1073, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1086, 1093, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1175, 1183, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1204, 1211, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1292, 1299, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1407, 1415, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1550, 1555, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1583, 1591, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1654, 1661, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1677, 1687, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1726, 1732, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1743, 1748, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

On landing two of the parachutes were on the ground; one landing on the parking area east of the drop zone and far way from my aircraft. I was at least 2;500 ft. away from them. The third had somehow steered his parachute over the runway and my only choice was to continue my roll-out because making a go-around would have put my aircraft closer to the parachutist.When I turned off the runway the parachutist had just landed on the edge of the runway and was pulling in his chute.

	["[I] was cruising at 10;500 ft. msl. Having just past the PMD VOR northbound and on a heading of 315; I was in the vicinity of WJF when I encountered wake turbulence from an aircraft. There were no traffic alerts or advisories; however 3 military aircraft were seen. One; a C130; was crossing west to east and ~1;000 ft. lower than us. Two others; estimated to be a C5A and a KC135; were turning south and would pass off our left wing approximately 5 miles to the west.

	["I'm submitting this form for a mishap because I feel that this was a 'human factors' event.  I had not flown any ag aircraft for about 90 days; and had been instructing a multi-engine student in an airplane he owns for about 2 weeks prior to the mishap.  I feel there were 3 separate distractions; each of which contributed to a breach of discipline resulting in a critical checklist deviation which led to landing without the tailwheel lock engaged.  The free-swivelling tailwheel severely compromised my ability to control the airplane once I selected beta thrust to decelerate the airplane on landing roll; the result of which was a departure from the runway and a ground-loop.The first human factor was a lack of recency of experience.  I flew this aircraft exclusively all of 2019; accumulating over 500 hours. As such; I did not do a refresher of ops procedures before going to pick the airplane up from its annual inspection.  Additionally; I have extensive flight experience in Air Tractor aircraft that DO NOT have a separate tailwheel lock control in the cockpit; the tailwheel locks whenever the stick is aft of a 'nose down' position.  I may have reverted to habit patterns from those other aircraft and 'dropped' the tailwheel lock check from my normal flows.  Lastly; the intense effort I'd been expending instructing in a dissimilar aircraft also played a part in this critical breakdown in discipline.  The need to check the tailwheel lock had been de-emphasized.Second was the fact that the right cockpit door latch vibrated to a barely-latched condition during the takeoff.  I noticed this during the 15 minute flight to my home airstrip; and it occupied my attention to the point of distraction.  I was concerned that the door might open in flight before landing; which would have certainly resulted in its separation from the airplane.  I focused on this concern; and overlooked my normal 'safety checks' in preparation for the landing.Another distraction in this process was the fact that the maintenance performed prior to departure had included new brake discs and brake pads.  These components normally require 2 to 3 landings to 'break in' properly; and reduced braking effectiveness can be expected.  I elected to land at our home airport; with a narrower runway because of my familiarity with the runway and the excellent weather.  I was aware of the 'soft' brakes; and I checked the firmness of the pedal and ensured that pressure would be available while on short final.  This concern; and the mental preparedness for the softer brakes; also intruded on my normal processes and played a part in my omission of the critical 'tailwheel lock - check engaged' before landing checklist step.Following this mishap; I noticed that there was not an accessible checklist in the cockpit of this airplane.  I will produce a copy of the relative necessary checklists from the AFM and post them in the cockpit in full view of the pilot; for routine use.  I preach checklist discipline and use with great fervor; and my error is a testament not only to my own fallibility; but to the overriding need to follow my own advice.", {"entities": [[2349, 2356, "WEATHER"], [2450, 2458, "WEATHER"], [103, 108, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [177, 183, "AIRPLANE"], [596, 603, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [655, 661, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [743, 747, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1065, 1072, "AIRPLANE"], [1126, 1130, "AIRPLANE"], [1514, 1521, "AIRPLANE"], [1522, 1526, "AIRPLANE"], [1583, 1590, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1647, 1655, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1741, 1745, "AIRPLANE"], [2014, 2025, "CREW"], [2240, 2244, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2282, 2288, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2324, 2330, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2798, 2805, "AIRPLANE"], [2918, 2925, "AIRPLANE"], [2946, 2951, "CREW"]]}],

	["After a turbulent approach in gusty weather; the landing performed by the flying pilot bounced three times. This caused severe damage to the fuselage. Main causes were probable fatigue; poor weather; and deferred items. The crew's duty day was extended the full two hours allowed due to passenger compliance complications in ZZZ. The weather was worse than forecast or originally reported; the worst winds reported by Tower were approximately 260 deg at 25G35. The deferred auto speedbrakes were very probably a contributing factor to the initial bounce; which led to two other porpoising bounces. Our scheduled duty day comprised of two; 5-hour flights with a 2-hour refueling stop in between. A schedule like this provides for very little sleeping breaks for the augmented crew; much less than a single long flight would allow.

Moderate turbulence was experienced on the approach. On touchdown the aircraft bounced and then bounced 3 times. At some point during the landing the aircraft fuselage was damaged.

The CA (Captain) immediately reported the wake turbulence to Fort Worth Approach requesting a 2 mile offset to the left which was upwind of the wake. ATC gave us an immediate vector to 165 degrees and descended us to 6;000 ft. When the aircraft was stable the autopilot was reengaged. ATC indicated we were following a Boeing 787. The CA called the flight attendants to check on crew and passengers - all were fine.ATC vectored us to the ILS 17C approach course right behind the same Boeing 787 that caused us the problem earlier.

The FO was quick to get back on glideslope but left the power in so [we] immediately found [ourselves] a bit high on the approach by 1 dot as the FO brought the thrust levers to flight idle.

ATC vectored us for the ILS 17L approach whereby a successful approach and landing was made. The company was notified as well as the Chief Pilot.

We configured the aircraft using airspeed from PFD1. Once we were configured the Captain transferred his PDF display to my side (control panel; both on 1). I was now flying the speed set in the IAS/MACH window; Vref+5. On short final Captain stated '5 kts slow' as per his HUD. PFD was showing Vref+5; same as set in the IAS/MACH window.

	["After reviewing [weather briefing program] and discussing with our Flight Dispatcher; we decided to file for FL 210 from ZZZ until east of ZZZ1; at which time we had agreed to climb to FL 390. [Program] showed moderate turbulence or worse for all altitudes from FL 210 to FL 430 along the route until east of ZZZ1.During climb out with TRACON we were informed that Center reported there was no reason to stay at FL 210 because there was only LT CHP with OCNL MDT CHP; and all flights were flying 'normal' altitudes. Based on that report we requested FL 310. We queried each controller about rides and we were told same as before. At [time] we got a report from Dispatch about MDT Turbulence in an area along our route. After plotting it in RTE 2; we determined that the area was about 25 minutes ahead of us; and that we would be thru it in about 5-10 minutes.We queried Center about ride reports and were given nothing different than before; LT CHP; OCNL MDT. I then called the Purser and inquired about the service and advised that I was turning the seat belt sign ON; and to hurry up and expect continuous Light Turbulence with possible occasional Moderate Turbulence in about 20 minutes for up to 10 minutes in duration.At approximately [25 minutes later]; we encountered severe turbulence at FL310. We immediately requested lower altitude. Altitude; attitude; or airspeed was uncontrollable; and the turbulence was so intense it was impossible to even press any buttons on the MCP. I disconnected the A/P and initiated the descent to FL 210 manually as authorized by ATC. Turbulence decreased when passing FL 290 in the descent; and shortly after I was able to reconnect the A/P.There were no injuries on board; but a lot of spilled liquids and food in the aft galley. I am not sure why the Flight Attendants in the aft part of the A/C had not been aware of the possible turbulence.We had the proper plan to fly at FL 210 until east of ZZZ1. In retrospect; I wish we had stayed with that plan. However; since both TRACON and Center insisted it was Lt CHP only; with occasional MDT CHP we felt conditions may have improved. I don't understand why Center did not have the same SIGMET we had from Dispatch. Even though we asked every new controller about the rides ahead; we actually were never sure how far ahead that controller was looking; or if he/she had any information about sectors ahead. Coordinate via SAT phone with Dispatch when these changes to the plan come up. We did inform Dispatch about our new altitude and received new flight plans from her; but a discussion on the phone instead of text messaging may have been more productive.\nFiled for FL 210 after conversation with Dispatcher; and [weather briefing] analysis. On climb out with Center; controller informed us that there was no reason to level at FL210; as there were no turbulence reports; and only smooth rides ahead. We requested climb to FL310. In retrospect; asking the controller how far ahead she was looking regarding turbulence would have been appropriate. With Center; and subsequent sectors; we queried them as to rides at our altitude. We received a copy of a SIGMET from Dispatch with a report of MDT turbulence ahead (with coordinates that we plotted) between FL 250-320. We informed the FA's (Flight Attendants) 20 mins prior regarding possible turbulence; and again queried controllers regarding ride reports. The answer that at most we could expect light to mod occasional chop. [29 minutes later]; we encountered severe turbulence. We requested lower from ATC. Initially; the aircraft would not descend. CA (Captain) disconnected autopilot. Aircraft almost oversped twice; and AP could not be reconnected. The controller had issued us a clearance to FL 210; but we could not reach the knob on the MCP; the turbulence was so severe. As we descended through FL 290; turbulence abated.

	["I commenced on a scheduled instructional flight with my student. We departed to remain in the pattern for touch-and-goes. The plane just returned from a scheduled maintenance. We did our preflight as per the checklist. The student did his preflight separate from my own preflight. We had full tanks of fuel and oil was over 6.5 quarts. Preflight showed no abnormal conditions. During our run up we went through our checklist and everything was in the norm. We did not have any abnormal readings or abnormal mag drops/readings. On our first take off and lap in the pattern we had no issues. We completed our first touch and go and remained in the right traffic pattern. I reported 'right downwind 12' with Tower. I was cleared for touch-and-go. Right before we were approaching to be abeam the numbers the engine RPM dropped to below 1000. I considered that the student may have started configuring a bit early. However; I determined the throttle had not been moved. I immediately added more power; but the engine did not react. I checked the mixture; which was full. Next; I checked the fuel selector valve; which was on both; fuel shutoff valve which was fully in. At this point we had already lost 100 feet. I reported '... we have engine failure. We're coming straight in for ...'. The Tower responded with 'Roger' and by giving us current wind conditions and altimeter settings. I was forced to make a split second decision and decided to execute a 'power-off 180'. The propeller stopped wind milling and came to a complete stop. I was able to glide to the runway safely. Upon landing I did not apply brakes; as I was trying to maintain enough momentum to roll and get off on a taxi way. Tower did ask if we could make Taxiway Charlie; which I was successfully able to do. The Tower did call over to the flight school to get the plane towed back to the ramp.

	["Beautiful day about an hour before sunset; time to go flying. I pushed the Cub out of hangar; hooked the tail to the tiedown and asked my wife; in front seat; to hold the brakes. I had done the preflight in the hangar but didn't turn on the nav lights until out on the ramp. After priming the engine the Continental 65 hp started on the first blade; as usual. Then I remembered I hadn't checked the nav lights and decided to walk around the airplane; giving it a wide birth since the engine was idling. Right wing; left wing; and tail lights were all operational so I boarded the aircraft; checked instruments; turned on radio and taxied to RWY 8.  After the run up we took off. On crosswind a neighbor called and informed me he saw something dragging from my tail wheel. That's when I immediately remembered I had failed to disconnect the tail wheel tie down.  I assumed the rope had broken and that's what he had seen. I also recalled a slight bump when I turned 180 degrees to align with the RWY. It occurred to me there may be something more than just the rope attached to the tail wheel. I turned east over an open field and considered what I should do. I decided I should land on a grass runway about 15 miles away with a sparsely populated route from our airport. It seemed to take forever since I made several deviations to avoid over flying any houses.  The airplane was flying normally; I did not feel any indication of more than just a rope trailing the aircraft but thought it prudent to stay away form buildings on the ground. I made a straight in approach; observed no other traffic.  When I flared for the touch down I felt a distinct bump; it happened twice then stopped as I touched down. After stopping and shutting the engine off I left the Cub on the runway and checked the tailwheel. Nothing was attached; but about 500 feet behind me I noticed a large object on the runway.  I walked to it and picked up the rope; still attached to an 8 inch ball of concrete. What amazed me the most was how could I not notice any change in the aircraft performance with that concrete attached. I checked the tail wheel and did not see any damage so I left the concrete in the trash and flew home. After several hours of going over how this could have happened I developed the chain of events.1. The ramp had been plowed from a 6 inch snow fall a few days earlier. The snow had melted and I saw where the plow had struck the tiedown I used and loosened the concrete holding the metal hook.2. The melted snow had soaked the area around the concrete softening the soil holding the tiedown.3. I usually tiedown the tail; start the engine then immediately disconnect the tiedown from the tail wheel.  This time; however; I decided to check the nav lights before releasing the tail wheel. By the time I walked around the aircraft; I completely missed the tail wheel.I did not get a chance to weigh the piece of concrete that broke out of the ground but it was fairly heavy. What strikes me most odd is I felt absolutely nothing while taxiing; taking off; and en-route that this was attached. (Aside from a slight bump when when doing a 180 on the runway.) I am going to repair the tie-down and bury the stake in the concrete below the level of the dirt so the snowplow will not be able to knock it loose in the future.

ATC gave us an immediate vector to 165 degrees and descended us to 6;000 feet. When the aircraft was stable the autopilot was reengaged. ATC indicated we were following a B787. The CA called the FAs to check on crew and passengers - all were fine. ATC vectored us to the ILS 17C approach course right behind the same B787 that caused us the problem earlier. We were aware of the situation and commenced the approach. All went well until we started to get light turbulence near the PENNY checkpoint. The FO remained high on the glide-slope but at a half dot high and going higher the CA requested the FO descent not to exceed 1500 FPM.All checklists were complied with; handoffs to Tower; and cleared to land. The FO complied and clicked off the autopilot to hand fly the approach as the runway was in sight and the FO was visual. Crossing the final approach fix at Jiffy and stable by 1;000 feet AFE the turbulence started up again and a noticeable downdraft occurred whereby the aircraft was momentarily at 1;000 FPM as the FO added power. The CA called one dot low at 750 feet (happened fast). No windshear caution or alert. The FO was quick to get back on glideslope; but left the power in so immediately found us a bit high on the approach by 1 dot. As the FO brought the thrust levers to flight idle at 150 feet the CA called the go-around. ATC was immediately notified of the missed approach and all checklists and call outs were complied with according to the flight manual and company procedures. ATC vectored us for the ILS 17L approach whereby a successful approach and landing was made. The Company was notified as well as the Regional Chief Pilot.Preventative Actions: ATC should be cognizant of the wind direction when wind parallels the arrival corridor. Wake turbulence remains along the course lines of arrival and lingers longer than when winds are perpendicular to the arrival course lines.

	["Approximately 700 ft. high at LTOWN crossing restriction; on the BLUZZ2 arrival to MEM. Earlier; while 20 nm. prior to top of descent point; we experienced the Boeing 'VNAV Anomaly' when descending from FL350 to FL340. Crew corrected the issue and resumed a normal VNAV descent via the BLUZZ2; landing north. At approximately FL180 the aircraft again experienced the Boeing 'VNAV Anomaly;' as it performed an uncommanded level off at FL180 and began an uncommanded deceleration. Attempting to remedy the problem; the First Officer (Pilot Flying) selected FLCH; 280 kts.; and 14;000 ft. (at or above altitude for LTOWN; our next fix). Recognizing that the autopilot was not responding in a timely manner; I took control of the aircraft; disengaged the autopilot and attempted to intercept the vertical flight path. I then recognized we would not intercept the path in time to make the 16;000 ft. restriction at LTOWN; and notified MEM Approach that we would 'cross LTOWN high.' We crossed LTOWN at approximately 16;700 ft. Shortly after LTOWN we recaptured the descent path. I returned control of the aircraft to the First Officer; who flew the rest of the uneventful arrival in FLCH. After landing; we wrote up the FL180 VNAV Anomaly in the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook.Crew failed to recognize the difficulty in making the LTOWN altitude restriction in a timely manner. Complicating our ability to recognize this was a previous unknown place (well past top of descent) for the Boeing VNAV Anomaly to occur. We never expected it to happen in the middle of an arrival descent. MEM altimeter setting was 30.24 in Hg; making aircraft tend to arrive high and/or fast at LTOWN. A frequency change to MEM Approach occurred at FL180; distracting the crew at the worst possible moment. The VNAV Anomaly occurred just as the crew was running the In Range Checklist; again worst possible moment. Include this scenario in simulator training. Flight Training provides a demo of the Boeing VNAV Anomaly; but never mentions that it can occur at any time; not just at top of descent. This crew now recognizes and will be ready to react quickly to the VNAV Anomaly at any point in flight. It's probably too much to ask; but please request that Air Traffic Controllers avoid frequency changes during climbs/descents right at FL180.", {"entities": [[14, 20, "ALTITUDE"], [126, 133, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [168, 172, "ABBREVIATION"], [187, 197, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [203, 208, "ALTITUDE"], [212, 217, "ALTITUDE"], [265, 269, "ABBREVIATION"], [270, 277, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [294, 301, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [326, 331, "ALTITUDE"], [375, 379, "ABBREVIATION"], [434, 439, "ALTITUDE"], [517, 530, "CREW"], [565, 568, "ABBREVIATION"], [575, 584, "ALTITUDE"], [655, 664, "AIRPLANE"], [751, 760, "AIRPLANE"], [884, 893, "ALTITUDE"], [934, 942, "CREW"], [1011, 1020, "ALTITUDE"], [1060, 1067, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1116, 1129, "CREW"], [1135, 1139, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1215, 1220, "ALTITUDE"], [1221, 1225, "ABBREVIATION"], [1250, 1261, "CREW"], [1461, 1468, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1485, 1489, "ABBREVIATION"], [1567, 1574, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1580, 1589, "AIRPLANE"], [1639, 1645, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1699, 1707, "CREW"], [1720, 1725, "ALTITUDE"], [1782, 1786, "ABBREVIATION"], [1977, 1981, "ABBREVIATION"], [2060, 2067, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2136, 2140, "ABBREVIATION"], [2283, 2289, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2290, 2298, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2308, 2313, "ALTITUDE"]]}],

	["ITO Runway 8 Visual Approaches; especially at night or marginal VFR conditions; constitutes increased risk and requires additional resources to mitigate this risk. The ITO airport information pages directs us to 'at night; plan on arrivals to Runway 26;' but tailwinds and wet runways often prevent this option. The airport information pages also directs us to 'follow the shoreline south to Hilo Bay to intercept Runway 8 final.' The issue is that the shoreline is only 1.5 NM west of the approach end of the extended centerline of Runway 8; which correlates to a maximum wings level altitude of 500 feet AGL upon rollout for a three degree glideslope. To even achieve this minimum; the approach requires 'cheating' by offsetting further inland over downtown Hilo prior to the turn to final; to account for the turn radius which would be even greater with increased speeds associated with a flaps 15; single engine approach (such as an ETOPS single engine divert event); or accepting a steeper glideslope and rate of descent. Additive conditions such as the common inclement weather and winds and relatively sparse ambient lighting associated with Hilo; high terrain; (Company) Crews' relative unfamiliarity with the new ITO service; and the short inter-island flight times (which limit time to brief and prepare for a challenging approach) all add to the increased risk. Inter-island flying is often benign; but the ITO Runway 8 Visual is a challenging approach under the best of circumstances and could surprise unfamiliar ETOPS Aircrew without adequate awareness and preparation.I recommend the following steps be taken to mitigate the ITO Runway 8 Visual.1. Expedite the creation of an RNAV visual to ITO Runway 8 to assist in situational awareness during the approach.2. Make all ITO Runway 8 approaches Captain Only landings until the RNAV 8 Approach is created. The descending left hand turn landing is even more challenging for the FO who has to look through the Captain during the approach; and the additional experience level of the Captain should help mitigate the risk.3. Increase awareness through RBF's; notes on weather packets and Dispatch Releases describing the risks associated with the ITO Runway 8 Approach.4. Encourage briefing of ITO Runway 8 Visual Approach procedures on the ground prior to departing for ITO when Runway 8 is in use; due to the short inter-island flight time.5.

While enroute the Sector Manager alerted me that there is a belief that a passenger onboard may have symptoms of COVID-19 and the flight may be met at the gate by CDC (Center for Disease Control) agents. This of course necessitated an immediate call to the Captain operating the flight to ensure he and the flight deck crew were in the loop that his flight was possibly under suspicion of carry a passenger with COVID-19. The Captain called the lead Purser of the flight attendants and asked for an update. They said the passenger seemed fine now. The Captain confirmed through ACARS messaging and SATCOM updates that no preventative action was required. The flight arrived safely into ZZZ as scheduled and no CDC agents met the flight.We had a bit of a communication breakdown as misinformation caused misunderstandings. It was initially believed a flight attendant called Medlink or [Operations Control] expressing concern for passenger. This was not the case. The Sector Manager approached me with updates and informed me of CDC personnel can be expected to approach the aircraft once it reached the gate. Fortunately this did not materialize as it turned out to be a false alarm. We are going to need more information on what policies or procedures may be implemented and how can we protect a passenger if they are falsely accused of having COVID-19. And if a passenger does have it and it is known how will the passengers onboard be informed and how will suspected COVID-19 infected passenger be safely removed from the aircraft? Will the aircraft be subject to quarantine? Will the flight be isolated from terminal and remotely parked? A lot of unanswered questions. [Operations Control] is making serious efforts to address the issue with a newly dedicated support team however this information in [publication] came out the day this event actually transpired and I was unable to use that service as recommended.

	["I departed ZZZ out to the North Practice area; outside the Class C airspace for routine training maneuvers in a Cessna 172.  The sky's were clear and full VMC. During the maneuvers I began to get airsick after I pulled open the cabin heat system.  After some time of using the cabin heat I closed the system and continued my training maneuvers thinking the airsickness would go away since it has never been a problem.  During my maneuvers I began to get cold again so I opened the cabin heat again and continued more maneuvers.  I continued to get airsick. During this period; I think about 30 minutes into the flight; I thought I smelled exhaust so I immediately opened the overhead cabin vents; opened the window and closed cabin heat.  I still felt alert so I did not consider myself impaired; just nauseated.  I picked up the ZZZ ATIS then contacted approach to return to ZZZ.  Approach instructed me to stay in the practice area due to traffic.  I continued circling in the area waiting for Approach to allow me to return.  I think by this time I had been flying for about an hour; not sure. I believe I was flying around 3000 feet. I continued to circle; but eventually started calling Approach to see if I could return because I wasn't feeling any better; but felt worse.  I am not sure if I was missing their radio calls.I eventually received permission to return on a heading of 150.  I turned to 150 and entered the Class C airspace.  Approximately 5 miles from the field I was informed I would be performing a box pattern to allow traffic to land ZZZ.  Approach or Tower (I can't remember) gave me a left turn to 100.  I remember immediately turning to the right thinking this would be more direct.  I realized I was confused and asked the controller to verify a left turn to 100 is really what they wanted me to do.  They confirmed the instructions so I made a left turn to 100 thinking this would be a complete 360 turn to 100 from my current heading of 150.  When I came to 100 I realized I was confused and this is when I realized I may be impaired due to CO poisoning.  ATC came back and asked be to make a left turn to 360 which I did and I believe I did acknowledge the instruction.  Some time after turning north I remember hearing ATC asking me if I copied their last transmission; which I realized I must have missed their call.  I responded by stating that I did not hear their transmission and that I was getting confused with their instructions and that I believe I was suffering from CO poisoning.  I believe I asked them to get me back to the airport as soon as they could.ATC gave me an immediate clearance to land runway 28.  I was able to turn the plane to 28 although I was very tired by this time.  During the final visual approach I noticed I was a little slow in responding to airspeed and power changes; but I was able to land the plane and taxi off the runway.  I met the fire trucks and sat on the taxi way for a while catching my breath.  I told ATC I thought I could taxi the plane to parking.  After parking the plane; EMTs met me at the plane.  I did not realize how impaired I was until the EMT's asked me some questions.  I remember the EMT asking me my name and I could not immediately tell him.  He then asked me how many quarters are in a dollar.  I could not remember and I had to take some time to figure out the answer.

	["I recently read a FAA legal interpretation regarding the 'required' minimum crew compliment on the Cessna Model 525 series of airplanes.  The interpretation was written in [Month year] in response to several questions by [name removed]; so I will hereinafter refer to it as the '[name removed] interpretation.' The conclusions reached in the [name] interpretation are not widely known among CE525 pilots; so they are still being debated some ten years later. I am submitting this report to NASA ASRS because I believe the reasoning used to arrive at some of its conclusions is flawed and ought to be revisited.According to Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) No. A1W1; the 'minimum crew requirement for all flight operations' in the CE525 is: (see NOTE 5 for cockpit equipment/arrangement restrictions): One pilot (in the left pilot seat) plus additional equipment as specified in the Kinds of Operations Equipment List (KOEL) contained in the Limitations Section of the FAA Approved AFM OR One pilot and one copilotNOTE 5: Approval for operation with a minimum crew of one pilot is based upon the cockpit equipment installation and arrangement evaluated during FAA certification testing. No significant changes may be made to the installed cockpit equipment or arrangement (EFIS; autopilot; avionics; etc.); except as permitted by the approved MMEL; without prior concurrence from the responsible Aircraft Certification Office.  The FAA approved Airplane Flight Manual for the CE525A adds some detail to the minimum crew requirement.MINIMUM CREWExcept where otherwise prescribed by applicable operating limitations;Minimum crew for all operations: 1 Pilot; provided:1. The pilot holds a CE525(S); single pilot; type rating.2. The airplane is equipped for single pilot operation in accordance with the Kinds of Operation Equipment List.3. The pilot occupies the left seat.Or1 Pilot and 1 Copilot; provided:1. The pilot in command holds a CE525(S) or CE525 (second in command required) type rating.According to the Kinds of Operation Equipment List (KOEL) in the CE525A Airplane Flight Manual; 'the following are required when the airplane is operated by a crew of one pilot; per applicable operating rules:'1. Operable FCS-3000 Autopilot.2. Headset with microphone (must be worn).3. FAA Approved Pilot's Abbreviated Checklist; Cessna PN 525ACLANP-04 and 525ACLEAP-04 or later approved revision.4. Provisions for the storage and retention of navigation charts; accessible to the pilot from the pilot station.Stripped down to its most basic language the minimum crew requirement reads as follows:A. One pilotORB. One pilot and one copilotThe conjunction 'or' is essential. Its usage here simply indicates a choice between two equally valid alternatives. One or the other. A or B. B or A. The order of each option is irrelevant. The [name] interpretation; however; requires us to take them in order. More to point; it makes option A controlling by creating a hierarchy of conditional alternatives. In other words; the [name] interpretation says that whenever the governing provisions of choice A have been met; if option A is true; then A controls and option B is automatically invalid. B is only a valid option when A is false.  Using the '[Name] Test' the minimum 'required' crew must always be '1 pilot' whenever the provisions in the Type Certificate Data Sheet (TCDS) for single pilot operation; option A; have been met. The [name] Test seeks to find the absolute minimum crew requirement based solely on the type rating held by the pilot in command although a plain reading of the text does not endorse such a finding. The plain; unambiguous; and quite simple language of the TCDS disproves this analysis. It clearly informs the reader that there are two equally valid ways to meet the minimum crew requirement. Moreover; it tells us that the two options are entirely independent of one another.Taking the first option; the airplane may be flown by one pilot; provided certain additional conditions have been satisfied. By taking the second option; the airplane may also be flown by a crew of two; one pilot and one copilot; but only if one additional condition is satisfied.Moreover; the [name] interpretation yields a result that is contrary to all that we are taught regarding aeronautical decision making (ADM); risk management; and resource management (SPRM/CRM). The mere fact that a given pilot holds a CE525(S); single pilot type rating; does not; and ought never; necessitate that he exercise the privilege. In the immortal words of Dirty Harry; 'A man's got to know his limitations.' For the pilot with the single pilot type rating; the [name] Test effectively denies him the ability to make legitimate judgments as to the wisdom of flying single pilot under a particular set of circumstances. Let us consider a scenario that involves a flight from the ZZZ airport to the ZZZ1 airport in a CJ3. I use this example because I have made this trip single pilot; once; during the day; when the weather at both airports was VMC. I will not do it again; nor would I recommend that it be done. The fact that we may fly the airplane single pilot doesn't mean we ought to and it cannot mean that we must. 14 CFR 91.3 reads in pertinent part that 'The pilot in command of an aircraft is directly responsible for; and is the final authority as to; the operation of that aircraft.' If; after evaluating its complexity; and performing a risk assessment associated with a particular flight; the pilot in command determines a copilot would be beneficial or is necessary in the interest of safety; then that ought to settle the matter. I am also persuaded that the TCDS unambiguously supports this approach in determining the minimum required crew compliment for any particular flight in the CE525. In plain English it tells me the airplane may be flown by a crew of 'one pilot and one copilot.' This is how I; a professional pilot; the person at the sharp end of the system who is responsible for the safe operation of the airplane and the lives of my passengers; interpret the minimum crew requirements of the CE525 TCDS. I suspect I am not alone in that regard. Finally; there is the important consideration of operational control of the aircraft; a subject which was not addressed by the [name] interpretation. Operational control; with respect to a flight; means the exercise of authority over initiating; conducting or terminating a flight. The owner or operator of the airplane; having operational control; has the authority to determine the crew compliment of any and all flights conducted under Part 91. Many of the well-informed owners require a crew of two for every flight to enhance the safety of their flight operations. Unknown to many of them; The [name] Test necessarily strips them of their authority to exercise operational control of their flight operations in the CE525 by unnecessarily downgrading their crew compliment to just one pilot. Although the [name] interpretation says there is nothing that would preclude assigning a copilot whenever the minimum 'required' crew is '1 pilot;' it goes on to say that the pilot is not a 'required pilot flight crewmember.' In other words; he is merely a passenger who is occupying a seat in the cockpit without regard to his credentials as a pilot. This; I think; is absurd. It goes on to say that this passenger may be able to log pilot in command time which only magnifies the level of absurdity. Conflating how things may be done during flight training; to allow a pilot to log pilot in command time; with how they are done by professional flight crews in business aviation is unhelpful; it is irrelevant to the question at hand; and really ought to be avoided. 14 CFR 61.55 prescribes the requirements that must be met by a person serving as SIC 'of an aircraft type certificated for more than one required pilot flight crewmember or in operations requiring a second-in-command pilot flight crewmember.' The CE525 is unambiguously type certificated for 'more than one required pilot flight crewmember' according to the plain language of the TCDS. The fact that it may be flown by only one pilot does not and cannot change this. Since two pilots are expressly required by the TCDS and the AFM as one of two equally valid alternatives to achieve the minimum crew requirement; then the ability of the copilot to log flight time as second in command is without question because he is undoubtedly a required crewmember under the 'one pilot and one copilot' alternative. A disconnect still exists between the FAA and the pilots; owners; and operators of these airplanes. The foregoing analysis bridges that gap without the need to alter or amend the TCDS or the regulations. The TCDS; as it is presently written; provides two equally valid and independent alternatives to achieve the minimum required crew for the CE525 series of airplanes. It has the added benefit of simplifying the answer to the question in that it does not compel the words of the TCDS to perform a feat which is beyond their power to achieve.", {"entities": [[5001, 5008, "WEATHER"], [18, 21, "ABBREVIATION"], [397, 403, "CREW"], [540, 546, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [758, 765, "AIRPLANE"], [807, 812, "CREW"], [826, 831, "CREW"], [832, 836, "AIRPLANE"], [970, 973, "ABBREVIATION"], [994, 999, "CREW"], [1073, 1078, "CREW"], [1097, 1104, "AIRPLANE"], [1161, 1164, "ABBREVIATION"], [1240, 1247, "AIRPLANE"], [1274, 1278, "ABBREVIATION"], [1280, 1289, "AIRPLANE"], [1433, 1436, "ABBREVIATION"], [1673, 1678, "CREW"], [1704, 1709, "CREW"], [1762, 1767, "CREW"], [1842, 1847, "CREW"], [1866, 1870, "AIRPLANE"], [1912, 1917, "CREW"], [2167, 2172, "CREW"], [2282, 2285, "ABBREVIATION"], [2477, 2482, "CREW"], [2492, 2497, "CREW"], [2614, 2619, "CREW"], [3296, 3301, "CREW"], [3380, 3385, "CREW"], [3534, 3539, "CREW"], [3942, 3947, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3955, 3960, "CREW"], [4076, 4081, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4104, 4109, "CREW"], [4398, 4403, "CREW"], [4429, 4434, "CREW"], [4604, 4609, "CREW"], [4626, 4631, "CREW"], [4745, 4751, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4759, 4764, "CREW"], [4963, 4968, "CREW"], [5119, 5122, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5143, 5148, "CREW"], [5253, 5258, "CREW"], [5492, 5497, "CREW"], [5693, 5701, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5843, 5848, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5867, 5872, "CREW"], [5921, 5926, "CREW"], [6949, 6954, "CREW"], [7096, 7101, "CREW"], [7131, 7136, "CREW"], [7156, 7161, "CREW"], [7242, 7246, "AIRPLANE"], [7254, 7261, "AIRPLANE"], [7301, 7306, "CREW"], [7391, 7396, "CREW"], [7527, 7532, "CREW"], [7540, 7545, "CREW"], [7870, 7875, "CREW"], [7941, 7946, "CREW"], [8040, 8045, "CREW"], [8134, 8139, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8152, 8157, "CREW"], [8201, 8207, "CREW"], [8492, 8497, "CREW"], [8566, 8569, "ABBREVIATION"], [8578, 8584, "CREW"]]}],
	["I was in training for an add on glider rating. In the morning I completed my first solo glider flight and another 3 solo pattern flights successfully. After the first flight I remained seated in the airplane in the front seat and belted; as instructed by the CFI. I did not get out of the glider until after the incident. The plane would be towed by golf cart back to the end of the runway; connected to the tow plane; and a pattern flown. In between some of these patterns; the rear canopy was opened by the CFI and then closed again. I don't specifically remember if the CFI opened the rear canopy after the 4th flight; but the glider was on the ground for about 15 or 20 minutes. Before each flight I would check that the canopy was closed by pushing on the frame for the front and rear canopy; above my head; and check for movement. This is in the pre takeoff checklist for the glider. On the 5th flight; after the 200 foot callout for nose down; turn downwind; and land; the canopy came open with a loud bang. Seated in the front seat there was no way to reach the canopy frame and no way to close it. I opted to continue the tow to pattern altitude. Due to the drag from the canopy I had to abort my plan to fly a normal pattern; head straight for the nearest point on the field; and execute a 45 degree entry to a downwind landing with a final turn about 30 feet AGL. I estimate I cleared the trees by only about 20-40 feet. The damage to the airplane was limited to the canopy frame due to coming open in flight. There were no injuries. I believe when the CFI closed the rear canopy; he intended to latch it; but it's possible he failed to do so or failed to move the handle closed all the way. From the front seat; I cannot see or reach the latch without getting out of the glider. It is possible that the canopy latch was fully or partly open; and came open due to turbulence in flight. It is possible; but seems unlikely to me; that the canopy latching mechanism had failed. After flight it appeared undamaged. In the future I will insist that I myself close and latch the rear canopy if flying solo in this glider. If someone opens the rear canopy while I am in the glider; I will have to get out to positively check that it is closed and latched. I believe the procedure of pushing on the rear canopy frame is insufficient without verifying visually the state of the latch.", {"entities": [[215, 220, "WEATHER"], [775, 780, "WEATHER"], [1029, 1034, "WEATHER"], [1712, 1717, "WEATHER"], [1875, 1885, "WEATHER"], [121, 128, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [221, 225, "AIRPLANE"], [383, 389, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [425, 432, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [433, 438, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [856, 863, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [919, 927, "ALTITUDE"], [940, 944, "AIRPLANE"], [956, 964, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [970, 974, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1035, 1039, "AIRPLANE"], [1138, 1145, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1214, 1217, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1227, 1234, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1321, 1329, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1330, 1337, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1362, 1369, "ALTITUDE"], [1370, 1373, "ABBREVIATION"], [1423, 1430, "ALTITUDE"], [1718, 1722, "AIRPLANE"], [2099, 2105, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

The initial approach into OAK was standard; with an overfly of the straight-in approach course to Runway 30 with a right turn to join downwind. We were given our sequence and a lower altitude. While in a descent; Approach Control informed us that there was a change of plans and to maintain 4;000ft. We were currently descending through 3;800. We informed them that we were low and executed a slight climb to 4;000. From here several delay vectors were given so that space could be obtained between us and traffic to follow. The final vector was a WNW heading; pointing us towards MITOE FAF on the ILS. Approach asked if we had the field for a visual; and we did so we confirmed this. We were approximately 15nm from the field and accepted visual clearance for Runway 30. I was PF (Pilot Flying) and took a look at altitude considerations in order to manage the FCP. On the approach plate I saw the highest terrain topographic line showing terrain at 1;000ft MSL. At MITOE; glide slope intercept is charted at 2;000ft MSL. I selected 2;000ft MSL in the FCP and started a slight vertical speed descent that would have us arrive at that altitude just prior to MITOE; logic being maintaining 1;000ft vertical clearance with terrain at all times and setting up for a stabilized approach. On our heading we had a relatively sharp intercept of the LOC course and this intercept was to happen approximately half a mile prior to MITOE so I wanted to focus on proper course instead of altitude at this time and did not want to become task saturated with trying to 'dive' the airplane onto a proper glide path. The weather conditions were clear for the entire descent; approach; and landing. The terrain in which was charted and we were descending over has no light; creating a black hole effect but there are plenty of lights on the other side in which you can see if you are sinking below or rising above terrain. Visually the approach looked good. As we descended through approximately 2;500 ft; over the last part of the terrain; ATC confirmed that we had the terrain in sight and we also got the Red Warning 'L/G Not Down'. I knew of this message but couldn't remember what parameters triggered it and had a brief discussion with the Captain. He informed me it was due to terrain proximity. This was surprising because we had not received any Radio Altimeter audio callouts; such as 2500 and 1000. Using the vertical speed function of the FCP; I put the plane into a slight climb while we took a look to confirm that our approach was safe and we were not missing anything. A second message went off just as the first had; both were intermittent. By the time the second one had finished we were fully clear of terrain; and continued the approach to a normal landing. For the entire approach I also used the terrain on the Captain's ND (NAV Display) to enhance situational awareness and never saw anything more severe than solid green with a small section of partially shaded yellow.The detection was very simple. The first cue was a call from ATC. They never alerted us to the being below a minimum safe altitude or gave us an altitude alert; but rather it felt like just a check-in. The second more serious cue was the Master Warning message. Being unfamiliar with the specific triggers for this message I thought it came on at 1;000ft RA (Radio Altimeter); which was lower than I intended to be and was cause for a level off. After landing I looked it up and saw that the message triggers at 750ft and this was about 700-800ft less of terrain separation I thought we had; based on the approach plate and subsequent lack of RA audio callouts. There are two primary causal items that I see in this situation. The first is ATC. They did a poor job managing us and the other traffic in the area; and then theysimply 'cut us loose' in an odd position. It felt as if they were tired of providing vectors and separation so they wanted to wash their hands of it. The second causal factor was myself. I felt comfortable on the visual approach; although I realized it was nonstandard in how far we were out and our altitude. Usually more guidance is given and I probably should have insisted on further vectors and altitudes from ATC. Another personal factor is my experience level in the plane. I am new to my position and still gaining familiarity with how to most effectively configure the plane on approach in order to ensure a stable profile and prioritized altitude on the final straight in over altitude on the approach leading up to that. I didn't list this event as GPWS because we never received any EGPWS warnings or cautions. None of the modes activated. I knew when the L/G (Landing Gear) message displayed that our RA was indicating we were lower than I initially thought; and realizing my situational awareness was incorrect we halted the descent. Terrain clearance had been satisfied in my mind using the approach chart; the terrain on the ND; and visually. This has been a learning experience for me and I will be less open to the idea of accepting a visual approach at night over completely dark terrain; especially from a nonstandard set up.", {"entities": [[1798, 1805, "WEATHER"], [26, 41, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [67, 70, "ABBREVIATION"], [113, 128, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [184, 191, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [197, 213, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [272, 280, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [327, 335, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [397, 404, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [406, 414, "CREW"], [484, 491, "ALTITUDE"], [511, 521, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [593, 598, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [791, 794, "ABBREVIATION"], [796, 804, "CREW"], [1067, 1075, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1144, 1151, "ALTITUDE"], [1152, 1155, "ABBREVIATION"], [1203, 1210, "ALTITUDE"], [1211, 1214, "ABBREVIATION"], [1227, 1234, "ALTITUDE"], [1235, 1238, "ABBREVIATION"], [1286, 1293, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1313, 1319, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1382, 1389, "ALTITUDE"], [1467, 1475, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1535, 1538, "ABBREVIATION"], [1843, 1850, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1852, 1860, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1920, 1930, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2112, 2120, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2140, 2149, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2172, 2180, "ALTITUDE"], [2217, 2220, "CREW"], [2422, 2429, "CREW"], [2662, 2667, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2709, 2717, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2924, 2932, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2969, 2977, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3009, 3016, "CREW"], [3230, 3233, "CREW"], [3516, 3523, "ALTITUDE"], [3621, 3628, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3681, 3686, "ALTITUDE"], [3710, 3715, "ALTITUDE"], [3774, 3782, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3909, 3912, "CREW"], [4207, 4222, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4409, 4412, "CREW"], [4581, 4589, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4697, 4705, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5033, 5040, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5100, 5108, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5247, 5262, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["On departure my First Officer and I both noticed an acrid dirty sock smell. [We advised ATC]. We donned our O2 masks and executed a return to field. I transferred the controls to the First Officer; he worked the radios and flew while I ran as much of the checklist as possible prior to landing. I was unable to complete the diagnostic portion due to our proximity to the airport and needed to prepare for landing. We were fully configured 80 ft. low but due to the [situation] we elected to continue. Upon landing we removed our o2 masks noticed the smell remained. I shut the packs off and opened our windows. All in all I was fairly pleased with our performance in such a compressed time table. General observations. Communicating through the o2 mask is more difficult than anticipated. ATC obviously asks their required questions. If we have our interphone selected to facilitate coms between us; it makes it impossible to hear ATC. If we use the interphone in PTT mode it makes communication between us more difficult. The fumes were isolated to the flight deck. Suggestions: The QRH guidance for SOF event is complicated. With tons of great information for diagnosing a problem. The issue in our case was the compressed timeframe of this event. It would perhaps be wise to design a separate checklist for SOF on departure. That isolates the most important systems; and most probable failure points. Then defers to the longer checklist with time permitting. Obviously landing an airplane experiencing SOF is a higher priority than fighting the fumes. In our 11 minutes of flight time it was impossible to run the entire checklist; as well as the standard procedures; and execute a return to field. This necessitated prioritization of tasks and load shedding. In retrospect I should have completed the remaining checklist after landing. However isolating the packs and opening the windows cleared the smell.

	["While on approach to Runway 27L at ORD; at approximately a 10 to 15 mile final; we encountered wake turbulence. We were on glide slope and slowing to 170 kts. until the final approach fix as instructed by ATC. The wake turbulence resulted in an uncommanded roll to the right between 30 and 40 degrees. Upon the encounter the Captain who was Pilot Flying disengaged the autopilot and leveled the wings and began to return to the desired flight path. Four EICAS caution messages were displayed: AT FAIL; WINDSHEAR FAIL; STALL PROT FAIL; and AOA LIMIT FAIL. We waited a brief period to see if the messages would clear. They did not. At the Captain's direction; I began to run the QRH for the displayed messages. While running the QRH checklist for STALL PROT FAIL which included entering new approach speeds; the Captain realized that we were below 1;000 ft. AGL and not configured. We executed a go around. Initially we were told to level at 2;500 ft.; then instructed to turn toward the north and climb 5;000 ft. and expect ILS Runway 27R. During this time; QRH items were completed and we returned for an uneventful landing Runway 27R. ATC stated the largest aircraft ahead of us was an E175. Given the nature of the wake turbulence; we believe it is possible that we may have encountered a wake from heavier traffic to a parallel runway although we do not know for sure.As a recommendation; it may be prudent to execute a go around earlier in these circumstances. We allowed the aircraft to get below 1;000 ft. prior to realizing that we were unstable while I was running the QRH. Given the added tasks created by the QRH checklist; it was easy to get behind the aircraft.\nWhile on the localizer for ILS Runway 27L in ORD; we were descending in PTH mode coincident with the glideslope. Around 4;000 ft.; we began to experience wake turbulence with a slight roll to the left the autopilot compensated and returned to level flight then we got a hard roll to the right which resulted in a bank angle between 30 and 40 degrees. I took over the controls and recovered from the roll as well as initiated a slight climb to get above the wake. During the event; multiple EICAS messages were presented. These included AT FAIL; WINDSHEAR FAIL; STALL PROT FAIL; and AOA LIMIT FAIL. After recovering the aircraft and returning it to the desired flight path; I queried ATC as to what aircraft we were following. They said it was an E170. When I said we got pretty rough wake he said he wasn't sure what from since the aircraft in front of that E170 was an E145. We continued the approach while the First Officer ran the checklist. With the distraction of the wake event leading to multiple unusual checklists; I got behind the airplane and noticed the approach was not going to be stable. At that point I commanded a go around. We executed the go around; completed the checklists and landed on Runway 27R. Once on the ground the EICAS caution messages disappeared and were replaced by ADS PROBE 3 FAIL and ADS PROBE 1 FAIL messages.During the event ATC did not mention what traffic was on ILS for 28C; but I did notice on TCAS there was one approximately 2 to 3 miles ahead on that approach. I did not ask what type it was and being in IMC I didn't get a visual; however I suspect the turbulence may have been from that aircraft since the winds were coming from the southwest.In the future; I think it would be a good idea to go around earlier. We were hoping to get the checklists done but due to the number of them it wasn't possible and lead to a go around at a lower altitude than was necessary. Also; although my primary attention was still flying the aircraft; I allowed myself to get distracted watching the Pilot Monitoring make the changes associated with the abnormal checklists and this is how I got behind the airplane.

The R-side was aware that the emergency was a divert to an airport with better weather due to anti-icing issues on the aircraft so he gave the emergency aircraft the clearance they requested.

We then called the next Approach Controller to APREQ the aircraft descending to 3;000 feet which was approved. We shipped and dropped the aircraft as deadwood.

We are not aware of MEAs/MIAs/MVAs/MSAs/MOCAs or any other minimum altitudes other than 11;000 feet. For situations like this; I think it is important to be aware. I will be aware in the future and encourage my trainees and fellow area controllers to be aware.\nI came back from break and was told there was an emergency aircraft.  As I was sitting down to work the D side I heard the emergency aircraft quest 5000. I heard the radar controller call Rockford Approach to APREQ the descent due to us only owning down to 13000. Shortly after; the aircraft requested 3000 I had not yet signed into position and got a briefing; but I made the call to Rockford Approach to APREQ the descent which was approved and then my trainer overrode the line to ask if there was any minimum safe altitudes in the area. The Rockford Approach Controller said 3000 was the lowest they could go to. I then called Madison Approach to APREQ the descent and they approved it. I told the R side and he descended the aircraft. I then logged into position and got a briefing. The aircraft had been headed to ZZZ but due to anti-icing issues couldn't land at ZZZ and had to divert to MSN. The radar controller shipped the aircraft to Madison Approach descending to 3000. Afterwards; we looked at the overhead maps and realized there was a MIA in the area of 3100 and RFD as well as MSN Approach should have been aware. We pulled the aircraft back up and saw that it was stopped at 3100. I'm not sure if the aircraft ever descended below the MIA. Not sure what to recommend in this case. My trainer did ask the Rockford Controller is there was a minimum altitude in the area. I could've signed in quicker and got a briefing quicker. Due to the emergency aircraft not having control issues I think its possible it would have been better to ship the aircraft to RFD instead of working the aircraft that low in their airspace.", {"entities": [[1004, 1011, "WEATHER"], [1024, 1029, "WEATHER"], [2996, 3001, "WEATHER"], [435, 443, "CREW"], [502, 510, "CREW"], [511, 521, "CREW"], [620, 627, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [631, 641, "ALTITUDE"], [726, 733, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [866, 873, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [877, 884, "ALTITUDE"], [1158, 1168, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1421, 1429, "CREW"], [1430, 1440, "CREW"], [1463, 1473, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1477, 1487, "ALTITUDE"], [1625, 1635, "ALTITUDE"], [1724, 1734, "ALTITUDE"], [1782, 1789, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1824, 1832, "CREW"], [1868, 1879, "ALTITUDE"], [1983, 1994, "ALTITUDE"], [2353, 2361, "CREW"], [2375, 2382, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2550, 2558, "CREW"], [2572, 2579, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2710, 2718, "CREW"], [2719, 2729, "CREW"], [2795, 2803, "CREW"], [2817, 2824, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2872, 2881, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3018, 3022, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3051, 3054, "ABBREVIATION"], [3109, 3117, "CREW"], [3118, 3128, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3249, 3252, "ABBREVIATION"], [3253, 3261, "CREW"], [3388, 3397, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3486, 3496, "CREW"]]}],

He complied and ATC responded by telling us the Minimum Vectoring Altitude was 2;600 feet. TCAS was still commanding a descent so I continued down to comply. ATC then issued a low altitude alert and told us to climb but I still had a descent command from the TCAS and so I continued to descend and my First Officer again stated that we were descending for an RA.

	["FO 1(First Officer) and I were flying the first half of the flight. I was operating as PIC. We were relieved north of the islands in vicinity of [VOR]. FO 1 went to the crew bunk and I relaxed in one of the business class seats aft of the cockpit. About an hour and a half after we were relieved; I noticed something had fallen on the floor. That seemed peculiar to me; so I got out of my chair to see what it was. I reached down to pick it up when I noticed warning messages on the EICAS in the cockpit. Then I noticed that CA (Captain) and FO 1 had their oxygen masks on. I immediately went into the bunk room to wake up FO 2. He was getting up as I walked opened his door. Then the oxygen masks dropped. I said; 'They need us in the cockpit.' (The thing I picked up on the floor was the latch/door to one of the PBEs (Personal Breathing Equipment) mounted on the wall aft of the lavatory door)FO 2 quickly made it into the cockpit where he took up the 3rd observer seat; which was where he was situated at the beginning of the flight. I sat next to him in the 4th observer seat; which had no intercom transmitting capability. The first thing I noticed were the warning messages; FIRE MN DK AFT and CABIN ALT; which was now at 25;000 feet. I could hear the intercom and the radios; but I couldn't talk. Shortly after I sat down; CA directed FO 2 to go and open the door to the main deck and see if there was any smoke. He returned in less than half a minute and reported that he didn't see or smell any smoke.At this point the decision was made to proceed to ZZZZ; which was the closest airfield to us; about 250 NM away. I recall that getting communications with [foreign] ATC was difficult at first. We finally made contact and told them we intended to land at ZZZZ. They proceeded to give us vectors to the field. It's worth noting that I was primarily an observer to this whole situation because I didn't have the ability to communicate with the crew nor ATC. Communication between us and the controllers was difficult for a couple of reasons: [The] radio comms were intermittent. Language barrier existed. I believe that everyone (CA; FO 1; and FO 2) at some point attempted to communicate with ATC. Eventually; FO 2 made contact with Dispatch via Satcom. There were also transmissions on VHF and HF frequencies. This lead to a lot of confusion in the cockpit; as nobody was able to hear every transmission and there were constant questions as to 'who said what.' We finally received the weather for ZZZZ and were quickly realizing the landing would be a big challenge. Also; every time we received an update to the weather; the runway braking action changed. It appeared to be trending for the better; but ceiling and visibility were very low; along with blowing snow. They were obviously experiencing a blizzard. CA decided to hold over the field while we processed the information so she could make a decision whether or not to commit to an approach/landing into ZZZZ. At some point; FO 1 mentioned doubling back toward ZZZ which was more than 550 NM away. This is when I decided to dawn the green bottle portable breathing apparatus and make another check of the main deck. I'd never used this device before; so after I dawned the mask; I stayed close to 4th seat oxygen mask until I knew it was working. After 30 seconds; I was reasonably reassured that it was turned on and working properly. I made my way aft of the cockpit and opened the door to the main deck. When I looked down I didn't see any smoke. But this didn't satisfy my curiosity. I wanted to know if there was smoke lingering in the back of the main deck where the EICAS warning message told us it had originated. So I made sure all the main deck lights were on and I climbed down the stairs. I could see all the way to the back of the plane and saw no evidence of a fire or smoke. By the time I got back to the cockpit; I'd been away from my seat for less than two minutes.  I tried to tell FO 2 to tell CA that I went down stairs and saw no smoke. But he was currently engaged on satcom and couldn't hear me anyway. I felt that this critical information needed to be passed; so I took off my oxygen mask and shouted out; 'There is no smoke in the aft cabin! I walked down the stairs and looked all the way back; and I didn't see any smoke!' There was a brief moment of silence as everyone collectively caught their breath. Communication between the crew in the cockpit got much calmer at this point. We had been holding over ZZZZ for at least 20 minutes. Within a couple of minutes after my announcement; the decision was made to proceed to ZZZ; which was approximately an hour and fifteen minutes away. The weather was good there and we all agreed that this was now the best course of action.Enroute to ZZZ; I made one more additional check on the main deck and observed no smoke or evidence of a fire. I communicated this to the crew. Eventually; we began our descent for the approach and I noticed the 'FIRE MN DK AFT' message went away around 12;000 feet. At 10;000 feet cabin altitude we all removed our oxygen masks. We finally landed in ZZZ without incident. Upon landing; we parked on the runway while the crash fire crew inspected the outside then the inside of the plane. They found no evidence of smoke or fire. Suggestions: Know what the weather is for every potential diversion airfield along the route. This will help to determine the immediate direction to travel when 'land as soon as possible' is called for. Understand that wearing of oxygen masks potentially degrades intercom and radio communication.", {"entities": [[1414, 1419, "WEATHER"], [1505, 1510, "WEATHER"], [2495, 2502, "WEATHER"], [2623, 2630, "WEATHER"], [2714, 2721, "WEATHER"], [2726, 2736, "WEATHER"], [2763, 2775, "WEATHER"], [2812, 2820, "WEATHER"], [3512, 3517, "WEATHER"], [3587, 3592, "WEATHER"], [3852, 3857, "WEATHER"], [4020, 4025, "WEATHER"], [4213, 4218, "WEATHER"], [4312, 4317, "WEATHER"], [4687, 4694, "WEATHER"], [4854, 4859, "WEATHER"], [5287, 5292, "WEATHER"], [5329, 5336, "WEATHER"], [0, 2, "ABBREVIATION"], [31, 37, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [146, 149, "ABBREVIATION"], [152, 154, "ABBREVIATION"], [239, 246, "AIRPLANE"], [483, 488, "AIRPLANE"], [496, 503, "AIRPLANE"], [525, 527, "ABBREVIATION"], [529, 536, "CREW"], [542, 544, "ABBREVIATION"], [623, 625, "ABBREVIATION"], [670, 674, "AIRPLANE"], [736, 743, "AIRPLANE"], [796, 800, "AIRPLANE"], [926, 933, "AIRPLANE"], [968, 972, "AIRPLANE"], [1076, 1080, "AIRPLANE"], [1229, 1240, "ALTITUDE"], [1331, 1333, "ABBREVIATION"], [1343, 1345, "ABBREVIATION"], [1367, 1371, "AIRPLANE"], [1589, 1597, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1615, 1617, "ABBREVIATION"], [1676, 1679, "CREW"], [1757, 1761, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1961, 1964, "CREW"], [2056, 2061, "AIRPLANE"], [2138, 2140, "ABBREVIATION"], [2142, 2144, "ABBREVIATION"], [2152, 2154, "ABBREVIATION"], [2202, 2205, "CREW"], [2219, 2221, "ABBREVIATION"], [2242, 2250, "CREW"], [2296, 2299, "ABBREVIATION"], [2359, 2366, "AIRPLANE"], [2636, 2642, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2822, 2824, "ABBREVIATION"], [2951, 2959, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2994, 2996, "ABBREVIATION"], [3058, 3060, "ABBREVIATION"], [3270, 3274, "AIRPLANE"], [3430, 3437, "AIRPLANE"], [3453, 3457, "AIRPLANE"], [3642, 3647, "AIRPLANE"], [3745, 3752, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3889, 3896, "AIRPLANE"], [3920, 3924, "AIRPLANE"], [3969, 3971, "ABBREVIATION"], [3982, 3984, "ABBREVIATION"], [4159, 4167, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4230, 4235, "AIRPLANE"], [4440, 4447, "AIRPLANE"], [4491, 4498, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4941, 4948, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4957, 4965, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5026, 5037, "ALTITUDE"], [5042, 5053, "ALTITUDE"], [5054, 5059, "AIRPLANE"], [5113, 5119, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5162, 5168, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5176, 5182, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5370, 5378, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5464, 5468, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5579, 5584, "AIRPLANE"]]}],

	["After takeoff; as Flight Attendant #1; I got a call from cockpit around or at 10;000 ft. about fumes/odor. He made an all call.

I would describe this as a night-time blossoming effect of near collision; but on the ground (a first for me). I was able to smoothly but firmly brake to miss them and keep them from hitting us. They did not slow down at all; and I am unsure they even saw us. We then heard their crew contact Ground; 'clearing ...'; and they were given instructions to taxi to their gate. Unfortunately with the focus on preventing an accident; neither of us caught the call-sign.With us stopped; trying to figure out what just happened; my First Officer queried the Controller that 'we were just cut off by that RJ'. The Controller did not offer any explanation; and simply instructed us to continue to taxi to the runway.Our assessment was that someone missed the coordination between Tower and Ground Control to inform us to give way. I estimate the RJ was crossing approximately 30 to 40 kts. groundspeed and accelerating. We were single engine; so unsure of our speed. Continuing the taxi; I asked the First Officer to contact the purser to check on their condition.

We rejected the takeoff and began to slow on centerline while maintaining control of the aircraft. We notified Tower and were given instructions to turn right onto Taxiway M and hold short Runway 19. We exited Runway 15 at about 20-25 knots. Given those instructions it was my understanding that there was ample room on Taxiway M to exit the active Runway 15. I planned to exit the runway; stop on M; and handle the situation. However; there is no room on Taxiway M in between Runway 15 and Runway 19 to stop while remaining clear of both active runways. By the time this was realized while turning the aircraft and noticing the poor runway markings; we came to a stop with our nose approximately five feet over the hold-short line for Runway 19. Tower instructed the landing aircraft to go around and we were given clearance to cross Runway 19. Ground gave me a phone number to call and while talking with the individual I expressed my concern with how that instruction was almost impossible to comply with. Given that we need to clear the threshold of 15 to be clear of the active runway there; it is impossible to be clear of both active runways at Taxiway M.

The individual on the phone stated he understood that it is hard to do and that they have known that for some time. I accepted responsibility for the mistake. The cause of the incursion was a high-stress workload caused by a rejected takeoff and possible emergency situation. This combined with ambiguous instructions from Tower and poorly labeled runway markings created enough confusion for me to cross over the hold-short line for Runway 19. Looking back; it would have been much easier; either through ATC instruction or by crew suggestion; to instead roll to the end of Runway 15 (about 1500-2000 feet beyond Taxiway M) and exit at F. There is ample room there and even a runup pad to pull to the side. The short distance at Taxiway M does not provide enough room for an aircraft to clear Runway 15 and be compliant; while simultaneously holding short of Runway 19. Exiting the runway a bit slower (despite the high-speed cutaway) would have given me more time to assess the given distance.\nBoth runways 15 and 19 were in use for takeoffs. Were we waiting for our space in the queue for takeoff. We were given takeoff clearance for 15. At around 80 kts during the takeoff roll; the DOOR CRG FWD OPEN warning appeared on the EICAS. Both pilots recognized the condition. The flying pilot immediately rejected the takeoff and maintained control of the aircraft during the rejection. During the rejection; I made a call to Tower that we were rejecting. Tower asked for the reason. I replied with the warning we saw. Tower gave us instruction at that point to turn right on Taxiway M and hold short Runway 19. We both called out Taxiway M. The Captain began the turnoff and I looked to verify the warning and make sure there were no other serious indications that needed immediate attention. Based on the angle of turnoff from Runway 15 to M; I did not recognize the normal runway/holdshort markings for Runway 19. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that we were getting close to Runway 19 and called out 'Hold; Hold; Hold.' The Captain immediately stopped and that was when we recognized that our nose was over the Runway 19 hold short line by about 5 feet. Based on the clearance received; the Captain was attempting to clear the active Runway 15 onto Taxiway M and hold short Runway 19. However; there is not enough space to exit Runway 15 on M and hold short of Runway 19 while remaining clear of both active runways. This was realized too late as our nose had already crossed the Runway 19 holdshort. Tower directed the aircraft on short final to Runway 19 to Go-Around. When clear; we were given clearance to cross Runway 19. On the other side of Runway 19; we informed Ground we needed to return to the ramp area to have our doors checked. On the taxi back; Ground gave us a number to call and the Captain talked to Tower. The Captain expressed his concerns over the situation to Tower and Tower acknowledged it is a difficult/complicated situation because of the very short Taxiway M section between Runways 15 and 19. The crew was immediately placed into a high-stress/high-workload situation having just rejected a takeoff because of a warning and possible emergency situation. The combination of the limited distance on M between 15 and 19; the belief that we needed to clear Runway 15 while complying with the given instruction; and the stress of the rejected takeoff; created enough confusion that lead to the nose of the aircraft crossing over the holdshort for Runway 19. Because of the warning and possible emergency; it would've been better to take things a little slower. As a crew; we could've continued the roll on Runway 15 to the next turnoff rather than quickly trying to clear the active runway with the given instruction from Tower. There was nobody behind us who had received takeoff clearance so the extra 20 seconds to rollout to the next turnoff would have been beneficial for many reasons. Since most crews; like us; are probably unaware of the short distance between Runway 15 and 19 on Taxiway M; heads-up from Tower that you can't clear Runway 15 while turning off on Taxiway M and hold short of Runway 19 would have been helpful. I would suggest that the area on M between Runway 15 and 19 is marked as a hotspot on the airport diagram with a writeup stating that it is not possible to clear one of those runways on to Taxiway M and hold short of the other runway.", {"entities": [[3418, 3421, "WEATHER"], [27, 35, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [149, 154, "AIRPLANE"], [213, 220, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [242, 252, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [308, 313, "CREW"], [579, 585, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [743, 750, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [831, 837, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [838, 846, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [875, 879, "AIRPLANE"], [894, 903, "ALTITUDE"], [944, 949, "CREW"], [985, 994, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1043, 1049, "CREW"], [1238, 1247, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1280, 1286, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1338, 1345, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1418, 1434, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1694, 1710, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1792, 1797, "CREW"], [1817, 1823, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1824, 1832, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1975, 1978, "CREW"], [2066, 2075, "ALTITUDE"], [2312, 2319, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2352, 2358, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2470, 2477, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2504, 2512, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2561, 2568, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2584, 2591, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2623, 2626, "ABBREVIATION"], [2638, 2645, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2698, 2703, "AIRPLANE"], [2710, 2716, "CREW"], [2747, 2753, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2754, 2759, "CREW"], [2785, 2792, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2893, 2898, "CREW"], [2923, 2928, "CREW"], [2986, 2991, "CREW"], [3113, 3120, "CREW"], [3343, 3349, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3360, 3368, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3501, 3508, "CREW"], [3570, 3574, "AIRPLANE"], [3623, 3629, "ALTITUDE"], [3668, 3675, "CREW"], [3885, 3892, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3928, 3932, "AIRPLANE"], [3978, 3983, "CREW"], [4037, 4046, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4148, 4154, "CREW"], [4182, 4186, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4237, 4243, "CREW"], [4277, 4284, "CREW"], [4295, 4300, "CREW"], [4306, 4313, "CREW"], [4359, 4364, "CREW"], [4369, 4374, "CREW"], [4597, 4604, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4835, 4851, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4895, 4899, "AIRPLANE"], [5184, 5190, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5223, 5228, "CREW"], [5274, 5281, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5515, 5520, "CREW"], [5811, 5818, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5863, 5869, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

	["After demo while getting seated in jump seat; cabin began to fill will unusual and extreme exhaust.

	["This report is to highlight a concern I have when landing on Runway 21 in LIH airport and what to do should one go-around from inside the MAP; or a rejected landing.  From the pilot's view; a go-around with the rapidly rising terrain looks daunting in good visual conditions but throw in weather; low ceilings; reduced visibility or night; and a go-around could be even more daunting.There is very high terrain just west of LIH.  Within five miles terrain goes from basically sea level to 2;310 feet MSL right on the Runway 21 extended centerline.  There is also an 799 foot Tower just to the left of the extended centerline; about 1 NM away and just beyond the Tower rapidly rising terrain from 1;000 feet MSL to the 2;310 feet MSL.  To the right about 30 degrees from the extended centerline is a 1;418 feet AGL terrain/obstacle at 1;418 feet MSL.  Further to the west within 10 NM is rapidly rising terrain reaching 5;244 feet MSL.The RNAV (GPS) Y Runway 21 has a MDA of 580 feet making a DDA of 630 feet. The missed approach point is JABDI; 1.0 NM from the 21 approach end.  Going missed approach at the DDA would not be a problem as turn would be over the water to NAGAI. But going around from inside the MAP or a balked landing could create an exciting moment! There is that 799 foot Tower (probably in the turn radius) and rapidly rising terrain to the south. To the west; northwest is the 1;418 feet terrain/obstacle at four to five miles. On Jeppesen 10-9A is a Runway 21 Runway departure procedure: climb to 550 feet then a left turn to 090 with a climb rate of 400 feet/NM to 4;500 feet; but who thinks to look here when landing.So my question is; does the Company have any procedures (I can't find any) on turn direction; bank angle; speed; when to clean up etc. It looks like a left turn would be the preferred direction as it puts you over the water quicker; but then there is that 799 foot Tower.  A right turn might be advisable but then there is also the high terrain/obstacle at 1;418 feet.  Throw in tower instructions; a tired Crew; or weather; and you [have] a recipe for problems.

	["This was an IFR training flight. VFR flight squawking 1200. We had no contact with ATC. We were tuned to the ZZZ CTAF frequency. There appeared to be a lot of 'chatter' on the frequency - most of it was related to a variety of training flights. My student has approximately 300 hrs total time. This was his second IFR training flight of the day after refueling at ZZZ. I gave my student the following scenario: transfer aircraft from ZZZ to ZZZ1 back from the maintenance on an IFR plan flight. I asked the student to do a takeoff in simulated 0/0 conditions. Acting as the 'ATC' I gave the student vectors towards ZZZZZ (the initial approach fix on RNAV (GPS) RWY XX @ ZZZ1). The student was flying 'under the hood' with the use of 'foggles' in simulated IFR conditions. The student leveled off at 3;000 feet MSL and was flying the heading of about 260 on a vector towards ZZZZZ intersection. I was guiding the student through the proper sequence of IFR procedures. The student was completing the cruise checklist and I was guiding him through the proper leaning procedures. Suddenly; the Garmin G430 WAAS ADS-B alert flared up with multiple targets - these were hard to discern on a small screen in the expedited manner). Just a moment later; with my peripheral vision; I noticed an aircraft (a C172) on the 8 o'clock position to the left of our position; at the same altitude. The view to the left was blocked by the student; so the appearance of the aircraft was sudden and almost surreal. It was rapidly moving through 9 to 10 o'clock position in a very steep bank to the left. The distance between our aircraft was less than 200 feet and probably just over 100 feet. The aircraft on the; now; 10 o'clock position was rapidly descending (more than 1;000 ft/min) banking steeply to the left. All this happened so quickly that I had no chance to take an evasive action.

We waited on jetway and then I went on board to ask him if he could smell the odor. He said no and that his aircraft is going to ZZZ and we needed to decide if we were getting off. We were shocked. We had no idea that his response was going to be so mean. We called for a Supervisor. We told the Supervisor that we were willing to go if the plane would at least be checked out by a mechanic. Supervisor said that the Captain was in charge and he has final say. We were again surprised. We told her that the Captain did not smell what we smelt. It didn't seem to matter. Then the Captain motioned with his arm and thumb and said 'Your out of here!' to us. We were shocked. Its almost as if what we experienced didn't matter. We were told by the supervisor we would receive a point; etc. We all worried about getting in trouble. Then again; the Captain said we were done. Flight Attendant B and I went to get our luggage. I was humiliated and belittled. He was horrible to us. Flight Attendant A stayed on board because he thought he would lose his job. Flight Attendant B and myself went to Flight Service.Why couldn't we have had a mechanic check out the aircraft?", {"entities": [[439, 443, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [503, 508, "CREW"], [541, 548, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [619, 626, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [648, 652, "AIRPLANE"], [707, 720, "CREW"], [721, 728, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [800, 807, "CREW"], [808, 815, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1267, 1274, "CREW"], [1357, 1364, "CREW"], [1429, 1436, "CREW"], [1693, 1700, "CREW"]]}],
	["I came in for my shift and heard from a previous shift Mechanic that [an] aircraft had flown in with a passenger who had tested positive for COVID-19. The Mechanic informed me that the line Supervisor for that shift had received a phone call from company Maintenance Control swapping the aircraft out for the next flight. The line Mechanic had told me that his Supervisor had explicitly used the terms 'passenger had tested positive for Coronavirus.' The line side mechanics had already done their maintenance inside and outside of the aircraft and taxied it back to the hangar before the Supervisor had received the call from Maintenance Control; (to my understanding).Not wanting to rely on hearsay from a fellow Mechanic I inquired to the another Supervisor what was going on; to which he replied that everything was 'just rumors' and that they didn't know anything. I wasn't satisfied with that answer; so I talked to yet another Supervisor and requested that he make the phone calls necessary to find out the details. After making some calls; a meeting was held in which we were told nothing was for certain; only that 'a passenger may have been sick.' The company ordered that aircraft to sit for three days before having a deep clean then released.My concern is that the company management would intentionally hide specific threats to the health of their workers on the line. We have still not been given any explanation as to how Maintenance Control would come to know a passenger was 'sick;' there has still been no line of communication from the company as to whether a passenger had indeed 'tested positive' or was generally sick (as we'd been told later). The mechanics on the line still don't know if those words were used by management; the individual Supervisor who received the call from management may have been acting out of an abundance of caution. My follow-up inquiries were met with the answer that 'we just don't know.'My concern; indeed shared by many; is not the general threat of infection which may come undetected from any unknown source; but rather a specific threat to our health and our loved ones; that the company management would intentionally hide from us. Why did management swap our perfectly good aircraft? How did they come to know anything regarding the possible infection at all? Why wasn't Maintenance informed right way?

	["I was working Maui Approach and heard an argument between a Supervisor and Controller about a recurring situation regarding the Aircraft Y flight and Aircraft Z. Recently Aircraft Y flights have been departing HNL International to do military training in the southern warning areas without the areas being in use. This is a recent event. In the past whenever they attempted to do this HCF has contacted the Guard and resolved the unsafe practice almost immediately. For some reason this is not happening this time. The problem is they are doing acrobatics at 500 knots and climbing and descending 10;000 feet a minute in an area with commercial carriers. This incident happened in Sector 4's airspace but the fighters were flying back and forth between Sector 4 and Sector 2. I witnessed the fighters anywhere between 140 and 240. Again; no one was in contact with the fighters. The warning areas were not in use. The Sector 4 Controller finally had to turn Aircraft Y to avoid these 4 fighter jets. The problem is; if the fighters did continue toward Aircraft X there is nothing the Controller or Aircraft X could have done to avoid them. This unsafe situation was a distraction to the entire floor because everyone who knew it was happening would not look away until it was resolved. I don't know if it was a change in command at the National Guard or a change in management at the HCF; but whatever the case this unsafe practice has to stop. I can imagine a mid air or at the very least near miss with a commercial jet in that area. Aircraft X as well as Aircraft Z have flights that routinely pass through that area when the warning areas are not in use. Is this a matter of the NatGard and Aircraft Z refusing to coordinate properly or is it the Guard deciding they will do what they want because they can regardless of the danger to commercial aircraft? We have the warning areas for the specific purpose of military training. It is our duty to require commercial aircraft to remain clear of military training. The problem is if we don't know it is happening then we can't protect for it. The solution is simple. If the Guard wants to fly their Aircraft Ys in the warning area; then take the warning area. We will divert aircraft around it.

	["I was working NLC [North Local]; IFR WX (weather) so having to protect for missed approaches. I rolled an Aircraft X on a 090 [heading] initially protecting Runway XX miss. Landing assured; turned the Aircraft X to a 110 [heading] as I had cleared another aircraft for takeoff on a 090. I shipped the first Aircraft X to departure on the 110 heading. The following Aircraft Y was close behind the preceding (one with departure on a 110; one with me on a 090) so I turned the second Aircraft Y left to 060 vectors for spacing. As they start to turn; I see the TRACON starts to turn the preceding Aircraft X to the left cutting out the Aircraft Y I'm still controlling. I turn my aircraft further left to 040; and it appears TRACON does the same; so I turn mine left to a 360 to avoid any further potential collision. I shipped the second aircraft on the 360. I'm unsure if separation was lost but this was clearly an unsafe situation.This is probably the fourth or fifth time in the last couple of months; at least that I'm aware of; where a TRACON Controller(s) has turned separated departures from ZZZ Tower at each other; essentially un-separating them. The last we were told was that 'They (the Controller(s) at TRACON) would be talked to;' which clearly hasn't helped. As this situation going unfolding; I'm audibly making it clear to the tower cab that this is happening. The Supervisor was aware and made no call to the TRACON. Needless to say I was heated that they're (TRACON) still trying to put airplanes together and my anger escalated with the Supervisor doing nothing about it. I said out loud 'That's it; get me out' because I could tell how upset I was and that nothing good was going to come from remaining on position that heated. The Supervisor didn't do anything about that either; luckily a Controller was working TMC (Traffic Management Coordinator) and he came over and got me out on his own.When I got downstairs I called the Tower recorded line and requested a report be filed to look into the possible loss of separation as it was clear the Supervisor wasn't interested in taking action on their own. I called the recorded line again today around XA:00 local to ask if a report had been filed and the Supervisor on the desk (different than the one aware of the situation) looked and said they don't see anything that I described. 22 hours after management was notified of a possible loss and nothing is done about it. It really shows what kind of safety culture we have in the FAA. At least I know I'm doing my part to move toward a safety culture; but it's just really discouraging to feel like the other half doesn't care. I guess the only thing I could think of to prevent this from happening (assuming these situations aren't deliberate; but a lack of understanding how to separate aircraft on TRACON's end) would be that TRACON shouldn't be allowed to turn departures from the heading ZZZ Tower handed them on until the aircraft have vacated 5;000 feet (the altitude departures climb to out of ZZZ).

	["I was working the radar position; not excessively busy but a little more complex due to the amount of rerouted traffic from the COVID-19 closures. Aircraft X; a Large Transport heading to ZZZ; was already descended to 310; perhaps unnecessarily but to avoid faster traffic climbing behind. Aircraft Y; a Medium Transport bound for ZZZ1; had recently departed and was being step-climbed beneath traffic in level flight; requesting FL330 for the final. Initially climbed to FL270; I climbed the aircraft to FL300 to level beneath Aircraft X and received the correct readback of 300. In the meantime; the D-side replaced the interim altitude with a local interim; showing FL330 beneath; so the aircraft could be placed in handoff status to the adjacent Center and the climb could be issued later. Traffic was called when the two aircraft were side-by-side; to allow that Aircraft Y understood why he would have to level and in case Aircraft X saw him on the 'fish finder.' Within moments; Aircraft Y reported an RA; and stopped his climb at approximately FL296. I called traffic once again; and the pilot rogered back. I called once again to reiterate whether he was technically responding to the RA. Aircraft Y only reported 'clear;' and I returned with a roger. Shortly thereafter Aircraft Y climbed from FL296 to approximately FL303 and I asked him to verify level at FL300; to which he responded in the affirmative. The aircraft; who had reported level; appeared to be continuing [to] climb. I asked him to verify his altimeter and he returned 29.92; and stated something about adjusting vertical rates. Still not clear as to whether he was continuing his response; or whether there was a Mode-C aberration (being near the radar site); I was taking the pilot at his word that he reported level and with the proper altimeter. At their closest the aircraft appeared to be ~2 NM apart with 400 feet of separation. When the aircraft were finished separating and I was able to safely issue the climb to FL330; I shipped him to the next Center.The conditions of the RA were not clear; to be sure. As to whether the pilot was still responding or was through with the resolution was never properly elaborated; which led to some confusion. The pilot also indicated a vertical rate issue; which has been happening more frequently of late with empty planes climbing quickly. The radar site also being fairly close to the event also leads me to doubt the Mode-C. Was that a bad computer extrapolation; or was that the pilot climbing through his assigned altitude which he confirmed multiple times? And with the lack of clarity really; was he still responding to the RA? In short; the RA should probably have not happened. With empty planes and instead non-expectation of correct performance; the aircraft should possibly be separated by 2;000 feet for climbers. Until this Coronavirus outbreak is over and we resume normal operations; I know I won't be trying to climb or descend aircraft the way I would under normal circumstances.\nWhile flying from ZZZ to ZZZ1 we received a Resolution Advisory (RA). I was serving as the First Officer and Pilot Monitoring of this flight. Between ZZZZZ and ZZZZZ1; we received a clearance from Center to climb to FL300. At approximately 29;000 feet we received an RA. The Captain (who was the Pilot on the Controls) followed the RA PFD guidance to remain within the green area. I advised ATC that we received an RA and that we were deviating to remain clear of the other aircraft. We were IMC during this entire event and could not see the other aircraft; who was above us. We then received the clear of conflict announcement. Once clear of the RA; we reengaged autopilot and continued our climb to 30;000 feet. I advised ATC that we were clear. The Captain transferred the controls to me. The altitude was set for FL300; but the autopilot captured it at I believe 30;300 feet. I input a VS descent to bring the aircraft to FL300.

	["Aircraft X was a return to gate due to a reported fueling imbalance issue. After the aircraft was received; the fuelers (ABM) and the pilots determined that maintenance was necessary to address the situation. While the mechanics were working with the fuelers and pilots to troubleshoot the problem; I was the only remaining [ramp agent] to stay with the aircraft. I was pulling bags for rerouting in coordination with the gate agent. The pilot told me he 'did not think this plane is going anywhere'. I apprised operation of what the pilot had told me. Because of the misconnects that had already been removed from the flight and the probability that the mechanical delay would be extended; I decided to bring the remaining gate checked bags up to the jetbridge. As I was doing that; the flight attendant told me that he deboarded the aircraft because of the 3 hour rule. He and I brought the gate check bags up to the gate podium; where the passengers were waiting to speak to the gate agent. I told the gate agent that I would offload the remaining baggage and take it to the bagroom for the bagroom to reroute off of meters. When I came back down the jetbridge and out on to the jetbridge stairs; to head to the rear pit and offload the bags; one of the mechanics was standing at the bottom of the stairs. He said they were running the engines. I then noticed that the engines were; in fact; running. I told him that no one had notified me that they wanted to do an engine start; and that this was not the proper procedure for conducting and engine start at the gate. he said that the pilot had called about it. I said no one had told me; and I am the only RSE at the gate. I went to talk to the pilot about the engine start (while the engines are still running). I asked him why he never said anything to me about starting the engines; so that we could follow SOP. He said he did call the ramp. I said 'you mean you called Ops?' he said no; he called ramp; I asked him who on the ramp he called because no one had notified me. He said 'I called this frequency number 130.0; and they said it was fine.' I said you called Ramp Tower. You have to let us know; so that we can follow the appropriate engine start and engines running at the gate procedures. The fueler told me that he had not been told about the engine start either.This is the 3rd airstart/engine start GSAP-able even on my shift in the last 7 days. I told the RSE lead involved in the more serious of the 2 last week to GSAP himself because we have a need for training and lessons on the steps of airstart/engine start. In ZZZ; there is no formal training for this process. You only learn what's involved with the airstart/engine start procedure by happenstance. I do not know what type of training is available in other stations for this task. There is no computer/video lesson available or required that I am aware of. There is no relevant verbiage in the Ramp Manual or Safety Manual; that I am aware of. Of all the work we do on the ramp; the airstart/engine start at the gates is probably the most dangerous and complicated function that we do; yet there is no formal universal instruction for it.I am unaware of what the [airline] or [airline] pilot training regarding these functions is; but I would have to assume that whatever it is; it at least for this particular pilot; inadequate. Furthermore; the [company] Ground Mechanics seem to be completely oblivious to any requirements for this function; as this is the 2nd occurrence in the past month of no communication regarding the engine start.

	["The aircraft was very light with only approximately 5 passengers. We were assigned departure from Runway XX with the ZZZZZ 5 Departure.The First Officer was conducting the takeoff and I was acting as pilot monitoring for the departure. During the rotation the First Officer abruptly pitched immediately to 15 degrees nose up attitude with the flaps set at 15 degrees. It caught me a little off guard initially and I focused on the possibility of striking the tail and exceeding 15 degrees nose up attitude. No tail strike or pitch exceedance occurred however; the departure procedure requires a climbing right turn to heading 189 degrees to intercept the ZZZ VOR 159 degree radial to the southeast. The FMS and flight guidance commanded the turn climbing through 400 feet AGL and the turn was initiated per the guidance. Unfortunately; due to the light aircraft weight and initial climb rate the aircraft had not yet passed the ZZZ 159 degree radial therefore no intercept displayed on the FMS. At the moment I was busy with retracting flaps and flows and did not notice that the intercept would not occur off the current aircraft's heading. It was probably 10 to 15 seconds after completion of the turn to 189 degrees that we noticed the error and pointed it out to the First Officer for correction. ZZZ Departure made the comment that it appeared we missed the intercept radial and that he had received a low altitude alert on the aircraft due to the heading towards higher terrain to the southwest. Fortunately; it was a clear night and we were able to maneuver the aircraft back to the departure procedure with only minimal course deviation from published.Once established at cruise we discussed the situation and I mentored the First Officer on how I thought he was being excessive on his initial pitch attitude. He indicated that he was concerned primarily about exceeding flap speeds and that was his reasoning for initially pitching directly to 15 degrees. I pointed out that it would be better to pitch to 10 degrees and allow the aircraft to accelerate; and then increase to 15 degrees pitch as necessary to maintain below 160 kts airspeed with the flaps at 15 degrees.This is a threat leaving ZZZ that I had never previously considered would happen.

I retrieved the airplane and attempted to determine whether there was a mechanical problem. The airplane was amateur-built by me and I have an amateur-built repairman's certificate. When I examined the rudder pedals; I determined that a bracket installed to hold the cable used to control cabin heat could interfere with the left brake pedal when the left rudder is fully deployed. The control cable was bent where it entered the bracket indicating that interference actually happened. The rudder pedals are adjustable per pilot height. I usually adjust the pedals to the maximum or 1 inch shorter. The pedals were set to maximum length for this flight. This interference only occurs when the rudder pedals are adjusted to the maximum length/height and the left rudder is fully deployed. These simultaneous conditions must not have occurred previously.

	["After doors were closed but before engines were started the aft flight attendant called the cockpit and said there was a strong 'dirty sock' smell in the rear of the airplane. We ran the QRH Smoke/Fumes procedure and that didn't seem to solve the issue. I made a passenger announcement and had gate personnel deplane the aircraft. I called Maintenance and they had me fill out the Cabin Odor/Fumes report which I did. Contract maintenance was called and eventually the mechanic found an oil leak in the APU. Around this time I went up to the gate area to discuss the issue with the First Officer. He said he had recently been down to the plane and the fumes were still too strong for him to return to the aircraft. I told him I would not take the aircraft until the fumes were removed. I then called Maintenance and they said the next step was to do an engine run at idle power to remove the odors from the air conditioning system. I looked in the FOM for guidance on doing an engine run at the gate and was having trouble finding the relevant section. I then called the Dispatcher and she put me in touch with the Chief Pilot. I explained the situation to him regarding the First Officer and he said that I would be fine if the mechanic was with me and we were towed to the remote location instead of taxiing out on our own power. The mechanic then called [Airport Operations] and they said a two engine run at idle would have to be done at remote location. I arranged for the tow; and did the engine run up with the mechanic per guidance from maintenance. After the run was complete we were towed back to the gate. I shut the airplane down and turned the aircraft over to the mechanic to complete the Cabin Odor maintenance action. I then found out the First Officer and the Flight Attendants had been placed on the next flight to ZZZ. I boarded that flight with a jumpseat listing and returned to ZZZ as the wait to talk to crew tracking was quite long and the flight to ZZZ was about to leave. I assumed since the rest of the crew had been booked on this flight that they had cancelled [flight] and had overlooked me in booking a seat back to ZZZ. In addition; I had a redeye to ZZZ1 the very next evening so I thought crew tracking would want me back in town for that. In hindsight I should have sent Crew Tracking a message from [system].It started with cabin odors caused by an APU oil leak that required deplaning the aircraft and going through the cabin odor maintenance process. The essence of the event is that I probably felt rushed to complete the cabin odor procedures so I could get the crew and the passengers back to ZZZ that evening. I didn't know at the time there was another flight to ZZZ so soon after ours or I would have handled things a little differently. I have learned a good lesson about self induced time pressures. You think you know all about get-there-itis and then it sneaks up on you. I thought I was being prudent by seeking guidance from the Chief Pilot and Maintenance but in retrospect I should have called my own Chief in ZZZ in the middle of an unfamiliar situation.\nA few seconds after I called for push from [gate]; the Captain received a call from the aft Flight Attendant and was informed there was a 'dirty sock' smell in the rear of the cabin. At the same time; I also smelled it in the cockpit. The Captain asked me to go to the back of the plane and see if I could smell the odor. As I got towards the rear of the plane; I could definitely smell the dirty sock odor. I went back to the cockpit and told the Captain I did smell the odor and we both pulled out the QRH for fumes. As He was doing the QRH; I called OPS and told them we might need to de-plane; which we did a couple minutes later. After all the passengers were off the plane; the flight attendants and I also left the plane except for the Captain who was on the phone with Maintenance and Dispatch I believe. About 30 minutes later; the Captain came out to the gate area where I was sitting and started talking about doing an engine run-up when maintenance was done to remove the smell. I asked him who was going to do the run-up as I said I will not do that. It was a maintenance function I assumed and I also didn't want to go back to the fumes (the reason the contract maintenance needed assistance was because they weren't qualified to do the run up). About 30 minutes after that; the Captain came back out from the plane to the gate area and said that I didn't need to be on the plane with him to do the run-up since there was no taxiing involved (they got pushed/pulled to a location about 100 ft. away from the terminal and did the run up there. When I went back to the plane to remove my belongings; the smell was really strong and I asked him if he could smell it. I didn't really get a yes or no response. As the Captain and maintenance were doing the run-up / pack-burn for about 30 minutes; I called the on duty Chief Pilot and told him that I didn't feel safe flying with the Captain and requested a deadhead back to ZZZ since the Captain had been in the plane most of the time with the fumes.", {"entities": [[64, 80, "CREW"], [92, 99, "AIRPLANE"], [187, 190, "ABBREVIATION"], [294, 298, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [340, 351, "CREW"], [427, 438, "CREW"], [503, 506, "AIRPLANE"], [542, 546, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [582, 595, "CREW"], [800, 811, "CREW"], [853, 859, "AIRPLANE"], [977, 983, "AIRPLANE"], [995, 999, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1175, 1188, "CREW"], [1302, 1309, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1398, 1404, "AIRPLANE"], [1495, 1501, "AIRPLANE"], [1545, 1556, "CREW"], [1611, 1615, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1714, 1725, "CREW"], [1755, 1768, "CREW"], [2134, 2138, "AIRPLANE"], [2360, 2365, "AIRPLANE"], [2385, 2388, "AIRPLANE"], [2457, 2462, "AIRPLANE"], [2468, 2479, "CREW"], [2561, 2566, "AIRPLANE"], [2995, 3006, "CREW"], [3152, 3156, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3163, 3170, "CREW"], [3284, 3289, "AIRPLANE"], [3334, 3341, "AIRPLANE"], [3347, 3354, "CREW"], [3535, 3542, "AIRPLANE"], [3556, 3563, "CREW"], [3612, 3615, "ABBREVIATION"], [3647, 3650, "ABBREVIATION"], [3792, 3809, "CREW"], [3851, 3858, "CREW"], [3885, 3896, "CREW"], [3901, 3909, "CREW"], [3949, 3956, "CREW"], [3973, 3977, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4038, 4044, "AIRPLANE"], [4057, 4068, "CREW"], [4181, 4192, "CREW"], [4284, 4295, "CREW"], [4401, 4408, "CREW"], [4445, 4449, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4547, 4554, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4608, 4614, "ALTITUDE"], [4630, 4638, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4835, 4842, "CREW"], [4847, 4858, "CREW"], [5001, 5008, "CREW"], [5056, 5063, "CREW"]]}],

I take pride in being the best I can be every day.That being said; I am disappointed with how the COVID-19 crisis is being handled.  As citizens; we are being told to maintain a minimum of six feet from others as a 'social distancing' measure; to wash our hands frequently and to use hand sanitizer and bleach wipes.  I have [been] in the simulator for six of the past 11 days; and have seen exactly one bottle of hand sanitizer in the building (which was gone last night) and one three-quarters empty bottle of bleach solution next to a nearly-empty box of paper towels.  Each simulator (mostly) has a ZipLoc baggie with a few supposedly sanitizing wipes on the computer desk outside the sim.  Oh; and a handful on the inside of each restroom door reminding us to wash our hands and not come to work if we are sick.  That's it folks.  We are better than this. Meanwhile; we have pilots cycling through the building(s) who have traveled to all parts of the globe in the past days; weeks and months and who have a very high probability of potential exposure to COVID-19; who have not been tested or quarantined prior to entering the building.  In addition to this; these pilots are now quarantined together in a tightly-enclosed simulator for 4 hours at a time.  Last night I saw an instructor wearing latex gloves; because he is concerned.  We have a perfect breeding ground for transmitting and spreading this deadly virus; yet the attitude I've seen as an operator for the past two weeks has been fairly cavalier.  I could go on; but I think you've got the picture. I don't want to be an alarmist; or simply point out the problem without offering a potential solution.  I'd like to suggest that as an airline; we petition the FAA to allow us to have a 3 month extension on all training events [12 months vs 9).  This would allow us to close the [training center] for two weeks for a hospital-quality deep cleaning; and allow us to stock up on sanitizer and protective equipment before going back to work.

I opened the speed brakes to help the airplane descend. One or two seconds after I opened the speed brakes; we experienced light turbulence or wake turbulence (I couldn't tell) and I thought it was related with the speed brakes being operated at that time. I started scanning all the systems looking for a malfunction but I couldn't see any. Right after that and just when I was mentally engaged with the airplane systems the Controller called for a right turn to a heading 150 and to intercept the [Runway] 19C localizer. So I retracted the speed brake and called for Flaps 2 on schedule and then I asked the First Officer what the Controller just said. My mind at that time was in decreasing airspeed to 170 kts. while descending and turning and hoping I didn't caused that airplane movement. I briefly asked the First Officer 'what was that'? And he said 'either wake turbulence or light turbulence' so we continued on a 150 heading but I was higher than what I needed to be and I didn't like the way that approach was looking so seeing that I was about 2 to 3 miles from intercepting the final approach course and knowing that if we intercepted at that time the airplane was going to start a kind of aggressive descent to cross the fixes at the right altitude; I decided to let the Controller know that we were about to go through the localizer. The Controller said 'no problem; turn heading 090 climb and maintain 3;000 ft.' which we did right away then we got re-vectored again to re-intercept the localizer.

	["During my first solo; I went to do a routine left-turn pattern and land on Runway XX of ZZZ. I took off of Runway XX and maintained best rate of climb. At 1700 ft. MSL I took called on the radio; and took a left turn for crosswind Runway XX. At 2000 ft. MSL I leveled off; and soon after called on the radio and turned downwind for Runway XX. Once I was abeam Runway XX threshold at 2000 ft. MSL; I began my decent for approach by slowing down and setting flaps to 10. I maintained an airspeed of 90 for the remainder of the downwind leg. I called on the radio and made a left turn for base. I maintained about 80 on the airspeed and engaged second notch of flaps. I called for final on the radio and engaged 3rd notch of flaps; maintaining about 70 on the airspeed. I descended on a stable approach and seemed to flare and touchdown just fine.The issue first developed as I tried to overcorrect for centerline placement after the plane had landed. I believe I overcorrected a bit too much to the right side; angling towards the grass on runway. At this point; afraid I would run into the grass; I attempted a go-around. The plane was able to get air-born just above the grass on the right hand side of Runway XX. On the way up; I believe I may have hit a runway edge light as I felt the thump on take-off. I initially thought it was simply the wheels touching the grass and continued on up. At about 500 ft. above the runway; I started to notice large amounts of liquid pouring out of the left wing. I quickly realized this was fuel and planned to complete another pattern and land. I continued the pattern similar to the way I completed it the first time but this time around; on the downwind leg; I reached for my phone which was in my backpack in the rear seat and called my flight instructor. Despite him telling me I can reach him on the radio; I elected to call him by phone because I felt embarrassed to call it over the radio; that I had an emergency. I told him that my fuel tank was punctured and he told me to land as soon as possible. I told him I would. I continued the pattern to land on Runway XX. I again attempted a normal landing but being much more nervous I made the same mistake of overcorrecting post landing. I pressed on the brakes as hard as I could and in the process veered off course. The plane went onto the grass and stopped. I was met soon after by my flight instructor and a Maintenance person.", {"entities": [[55, 62, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [67, 71, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [95, 103, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [145, 150, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [155, 162, "ALTITUDE"], [164, 167, "ABBREVIATION"], [189, 194, "AIRPLANE"], [221, 230, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [245, 252, "ALTITUDE"], [254, 257, "ABBREVIATION"], [302, 307, "AIRPLANE"], [319, 327, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [370, 379, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [383, 390, "ALTITUDE"], [392, 395, "ABBREVIATION"], [419, 427, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [525, 537, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [555, 560, "AIRPLANE"], [586, 590, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [691, 696, "AIRPLANE"], [769, 778, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [791, 799, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [824, 833, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [900, 910, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [941, 947, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1029, 1034, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1038, 1044, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1089, 1094, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1171, 1176, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1256, 1262, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1365, 1370, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1401, 1407, "ALTITUDE"], [1419, 1425, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1495, 1499, "AIRPLANE"], [1566, 1573, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1578, 1582, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1600, 1607, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1686, 1698, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1760, 1764, "AIRPLANE"], [1844, 1849, "AIRPLANE"], [1929, 1934, "AIRPLANE"], [1980, 1989, "AIRPLANE"], [2022, 2026, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2084, 2091, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2095, 2099, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2338, 2343, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2408, 2419, "CREW"]]}],

	["While climbing above FL320 to FL400 we 'out-climbed' the pressurization ability of the aircraft and received a DIFF PRESS Warning message. The cabin pressure did not exceed 8.6 PSI. About 30 seconds before the warning; I noticed our climb rate to be above 3;000 feet per minute. I glanced at the cabin pressure and saw it was at 8.4 PSI with a 600 FPM climb. I asked the FO (First Officer); who was pilot flying; to reduce the climb rate as there had been company communication recently that it was possible to exceed the cabin pressure differential limitation while flying with few passengers during the pandemic. We had four passengers aboard. About 10 seconds after the FO went into vertical speed mode to reduce the climb rate; we received the warning. We followed the QRH procedure which got the pressure differential under control and controlled the pressurization in manual for the remainder of the flight as per the QRH. I sent an ACARS to the Dispatcher and to Maintenance and had [them] meet the aircraft at the arrival airport. The recent pandemic has seen us carrying fewer and fewer passengers and as such; we are seeing aircraft performance everyday that we would have rarely seen. As such; we are not conditioned to look at the climb rate of the aircraft in regard to the pressure differential. There had been some recent company communication that reminded us of this issue which I remembered when I saw the rate of climb of the aircraft versus the rate of climb of the cabin pressure. I merely noticed and asked the FO to reduce the rate of climb too late to stop the warning from occurring. After the event; I went and looked at the memo again and will pay more attention to reducing my rate of climb once above FL300 from now on. The QRH procedure works well in reducing the pressure differential. The problem is that it does not address this particular situation (out-climbing the pressurization). Once we got the differential under control the QRH guides you to manual pressurization operation for the remainder of the flight even though I assume there is nothing actually wrong with the pressurization. Perhaps adding a line into the QRH to direct you back to automatic pressurization if you simply out-climb the system would reduce the workload of the pilot monitoring versus having to operate the system manually while maintaining the same level of attention required of the pilot monitoring.\nAs we were climbing through FL320; a 'cabin differential pressure' warning message populated. Pressure was 8.6 and never exceeded 8.6. Both the Captain and First officer were able to detect an increase in differential pressure due to the high climb rate resulting from low passenger and cargo load. First Officer was correcting high climb rate when the warning message populated. Later the Captain addressed the message with the QRH. Aircraft was in control at all times and the error was detected successfully with no negative consequences.Differential pressure warning message due to very low passengers and cargo load; resulted in excessive high climb rate above FL320.Suggestions: Better monitor climb rate during low passenger loads.", {"entities": [[149, 157, "WEATHER"], [302, 310, "WEATHER"], [528, 536, "WEATHER"], [801, 809, "WEATHER"], [1287, 1295, "WEATHER"], [1492, 1500, "WEATHER"], [1794, 1802, "WEATHER"], [2474, 2482, "WEATHER"], [2635, 2643, "WEATHER"], [2971, 2979, "WEATHER"], [6, 14, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [21, 26, "ALTITUDE"], [30, 35, "ALTITUDE"], [143, 148, "AIRPLANE"], [233, 238, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [256, 266, "ALTITUDE"], [296, 301, "AIRPLANE"], [348, 351, "ABBREVIATION"], [352, 357, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [371, 373, "ABBREVIATION"], [375, 388, "CREW"], [399, 404, "CREW"], [405, 411, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [427, 432, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [522, 527, "AIRPLANE"], [567, 573, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [673, 675, "ABBREVIATION"], [720, 725, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [773, 776, "ABBREVIATION"], [924, 927, "ABBREVIATION"], [939, 944, "AIRPLANE"], [970, 981, "CREW"], [1243, 1248, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1432, 1437, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1473, 1478, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1486, 1491, "AIRPLANE"], [1533, 1535, "ABBREVIATION"], [1558, 1563, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1713, 1718, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1730, 1735, "ALTITUDE"], [1753, 1756, "ABBREVIATION"], [1888, 1896, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1965, 1968, "ABBREVIATION"], [2156, 2159, "ABBREVIATION"], [2225, 2230, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2275, 2280, "CREW"], [2399, 2404, "CREW"], [2428, 2436, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2445, 2450, "ALTITUDE"], [2455, 2460, "AIRPLANE"], [2561, 2568, "CREW"], [2660, 2665, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2716, 2729, "CREW"], [2750, 2755, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2807, 2814, "CREW"], [2846, 2849, "ABBREVIATION"], [3066, 3071, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3083, 3100, "ALTITUDE"], [3117, 3122, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["Reposition flight to take an aircraft from ZZZ to CWA for storage. Weather was low IFR and reported 4 miles visibility and 300 ft. overcast. En-route we planned and briefed using the ILS to Runway 8 at CWA. Descending through 18;000 ft. MSP Center advised us to expect the ILS to Runway 35. We programmed and briefed the new approach and completed the descent checklist. (During the descent checklist; we were heavily task saturated. Reducing speed now for a mostly straight-in approach; following the snowflake to hit a crossing restriction; in icing conditions with several cautions for ICE and anti-Ice systems popping up. When on the minimums item; the Captain responded with the landing data information which I prompted again for the correct response and he corrected. Then the checklist was continued and completed). We were cleared direct to RELCO; descend and maintain 3000 ft. and cleared for the ILS into Runway 35. The Captain briefed that the final approach course would be intercepted in FMS/NAV mode then we would transfer to the ILS navigation (LOC/GS) once established. Approximately 5 miles from RELCO I noticed my altitude was indicating below our assigned and the charted altitude of 3000 ft. (~2500 ft.) and we were still descending. I looked at the Captains PFD and his altitude showed above 3000 ft. (~3400 at this point ft.). That ft.s when I notice his altimeter setting was 30.32 instead of 29.32 reported on the ATIS and by MSP center. I called out 'your altimeter setting is wrong; we need to climb'. The Captain proceeded to disconnect the autopilot to stop the descent and begin climbing. At one point I heard the Radar altimeter make the '1000' automated callout. The Captain input the correct altimeter setting on his side and climbed back to 3000 ft. while I informed CWA Tower of the error; the altitude deviation; and that we were correcting back to 3000 ft. Tower asked if we wanted to continue the approach and that they would contact MSP Center to advise them of the error as well. We decided to continued on the approach and configured the aircraft for landing. The Captain continued to fly a stable approach with the autopilot disconnected; breaking out of the clouds about 300 ft. AGL and making a normal landing.Incorrect altimeter setting on the Captain ft.s side. [30.32 instead of 29.32). Failure to properly execute descent checklist items. When listening the the ATIS is wrote down the altimeter and found it shockingly low so I listen a second time to ensure I heard 29.32 correctly. I mentioned this to the Captain and he asked me what the altimeter setting was in order to preselect it in the ISI standby altimeter as a reminder for later. We also had a brief conversation about how we had noticed the large low pressure system that was approaching the destination airport so a very low (hurricane like) altimeter setting made sense.Ensure to properly input altimeter settings; ensure to properly cross-check the entire altimeter setting including the values before and after the decimal place. (Making sure to say 29.32 not .32) Scan all altimeters more often to verify they are in agreement.\nWhile at cruise we both listened to ATIS and discussed the extremely low altimeter at CWA of 20.32. I then got landing data for Runways 35 and 8. I briefed the ILS to Runway 8. We checked in with Minneapolis Center who told us to expect Runway 35; which we accepted. While descending for a crossing restriction of CWA- Runway 35 at 14;000 ft.; I then Runway 35. There was a slight rush due to the change; but it was completely manageable. Descending thru FL180; I dialed in the incorrect altimeter of 30.32; even though I had written down 29.32 on my yoke chart holder scratch paper and dialed 29.32 into the standby altimeter. I then called for and we ran the Descent Checklist. While running the Descent check; neither I or the FO (First Officer) PM (Pilot Monitoring) caught the altimeter error on my side. I believe I said '29.32 Crossschecked'. We were then cleared direct RELCO; cross RELCO at or above 3;000 ft. and cleared for the ILS Runway 35. I dialed in 3;000 ft. and configured to be at 3;000 ft. about 5 miles outside RELCO to allow for deceleration prior to RELCO. Approximately 5 miles outside RELCO; Just slowing to 200 kts; zero flaps and gear up at a 1;000 fpm descent; I believe the PM FO said 'You have the wrong altimeter. We need to climb back up.' I immediately saw the error; clicked off the autopilot and climbed up to 3;000 ft. I then dialed in the correct altimeter. I directed the FO to tell Tower what we were doing. I elected to continue the approach since we crossed RELCO at 3;000 ft. The rest of the approach and landing was handflown and uneventful. Upon post flight debrief; the PM FO said he momentarily saw his RA display less than 1;000 ft. AGL. The math says this is most likely correct. I did not see this on my side; as I was busy. This means; we were unstable and in an Unusual Aircraft State (UAS) and should have done a missed approach/go around. I estimate we may have descended to 800 ft. to 900 ft. agl above airport elevation. The terrain around RELCO appears to be the same as the airfield elevation. We did not receive a GPWS which I believe was due to our speed; descent rate and absence of towers and terrain in the area.The altimeter error and continuing an unstable approach were 90% my fault due to the following 4 reasons: 1. Lack of attention to detail; dialing in the wrong altimeter. 2. Obviously not fully reading the CA (Captain) side altimeter during the Descent Check. 3. Not doing the math in the descent; when the FO PM said 'out of 4000 ft. for 3000 ft.' when my instruments did not indicate the same. 4. Not initiating a missed approach/go-around. This was due to my failure to not realize we were below 1;000 ft. AGL. I became aware of this; after we were level at 3;000 ft. MSL and obviously stable and in position to conduct the approach. In my opinion the FO PM gets 10% of the blame for the following 2 reasons: 1. Not reading my altimeter during the Descent Check. In his defense; it is across the cockpit and difficult to see. 2. Not calling 'Unstable Go Around'; when he realized we were below 1;000 ft. AGL; not configured and not on the approach yet. BUT; the FO PM does get credit for catching the error before I or GPWS did. I thanked him; but I did not shake his hand.PERSONAL: I should pay more attention to every aspect of my flight duties. I have been a Captain for nearly 20 years and have never had a training issue; ATC issue or any event resembling this. I and everyone are unavoidably stressed; which is distracting. 2.

	["I arrived at ZZZ to test fly after the annual inspection was completed. I spent three times the usual time pre-flight inspecting the airplane. The airplane has four different trim adjustment controls. All trim looked normal outside. When I entered the cockpit; I confirmed center on all four trims. The main rudder trim appeared centered; and moved freely. Prior to lift off I ran the engines at full power; and confirmed all instruments. Twice. All looked acceptable; except the right engine did not produce power to the red line. It was an inch or so below the red line. I made a note for the mechanic's squawk list. Along with three other items that did not affect safety of flight of the airplane. I requested and preformed a full power to full stop test on the Runway without lift off.  The plane pulled to the right slightly but was controllable with rudder use. I assumed it was P-factor. But after taxi back; I made a squawk note. I had filed a SFRA flight plan to [waypoint]. But understand that on a test flight I need to stay within glide distance of the runway. So I asked to stay in the pattern.  After the Tower approved departure; I applied full power and soon after lift off experienced the plane crabbing extreme right. It was controllable with full rudder. I assumed asymmetric thrust from an engine problem. I was at about 800 feet AGL so I decided to reduce power on both engines to manifold cruise power. The Tower asked me to turn left cross wind; and after I complied I saw the altimeter show 500 AGL and decent rate of approximately 400 fpm and Tower requested a turn down wind. So I added full power; leveled the wings; and was working on the problem; and again reduced to cruise power; when Tower said left base cleared to land. I considered landing; but was not configured to land. So I asked for a low approach. And continued reading the gauges; and controls; when Tower asked for a left crosswind. Again I had a high sink rate and added full power. On downwind; I found the main rudder trim control was set about one turn from full right deflection. Once I centered the control; the turn coordinator ball centered; and no rudder pedal input was needed. And once I was no longer in a side slip; full power caused the plane to climb at approximately 2000 fpm. As soon as I noticed the high climb rate; I dialed in stabilator trim; and reduced power. But I may have violated the overlying Class B airspace. Then immediately descended. My second pass was a missed approach. Now in control; I had time to configure the plane for landing. The landing; roll out; and taxi back were uneventful. After landing; I saw that what I thought was a center mark for the rudder trim control was a mark for full right trim. Possibly while lubricating; during maintenance; the control was moved. Two takeaways. It might have been safer for two people; to be in the plane for the test flight. (one to fly; and one to determine the problem) But I understand no passengers are permitted on a test flight. Second; I should have requested; direct to [waypoint] gate. So I would have had more time to determine the problem; without so much interaction with directions from the Tower. But I understand when on a test flight I need to remain within glide distance of the runway. No conflict with any other aircraft occurred at any time. And I met with the mechanic after landing; and explained the squawk list; low right manifold pressure; and the trim problem.", {"entities": [[1464, 1468, "WEATHER"], [1597, 1601, "WEATHER"], [3432, 3440, "WEATHER"], [2, 9, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [25, 28, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [107, 117, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [252, 259, "AIRPLANE"], [486, 492, "AIRPLANE"], [1066, 1072, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1100, 1107, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1120, 1125, "CREW"], [1311, 1317, "AIRPLANE"], [1342, 1350, "ALTITUDE"], [1351, 1354, "ABBREVIATION"], [1412, 1418, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1430, 1435, "CREW"], [1501, 1510, "AIRPLANE"], [1520, 1523, "ABBREVIATION"], [1569, 1574, "CREW"], [1698, 1704, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1717, 1722, "CREW"], [1733, 1737, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1749, 1753, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1803, 1807, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1830, 1838, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1893, 1898, "CREW"], [1916, 1925, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1981, 1989, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2254, 2259, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2317, 2322, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2450, 2459, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2482, 2497, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2770, 2781, "CREW"], [2910, 2913, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3066, 3070, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3181, 3186, "CREW"], [3273, 3279, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

	["On approach following three hour redeye. Visual backed up by ILS. Winds 270/25G47. Expected strong winds due to forecast but only 30 degrees off nose so went Flaps 3/MED AB and bumped up Vapp for landing. Approach fine till below 1;000 feet. Turbulence got extremely rough as gusts were pounding the aircraft on descent. AP doing its job but [I was] guarding controls. Somewhere between 200 and 500 feet (not really sure) a gust of wind literally lifted the left wing to almost a 45 degree roll right. It happened so fast and so abruptly AP never kicked off. I turned off AP and immediately counter banked back toward runway and level attitude. As I was doing that another gust pushed us right again and down. Never experienced anything like this in a jet. Executed Go-Around immediately upon second recovery. We are so light these days that Vapp is 119/120/121...ridiculously low speeds. At TOGA power; the aircraft climbed like a rocket. I was so busy working nose attitude to prevent flap overspeed and battling continued gusts that I overshot MAP altitude badly. After settling down and correcting back to MAP altitude; we set up and executed another approach. This time; despite gusts and crosswind; I was able to put the aircraft on the runway and conclude the flight. To say I was rattled would be an understatement. I am concerned that we are flying these aircraft too light. I understand the virus and crisis; too few passengers and baggage; but under certain conditions (like mine) I feel that aircraft was too light for what it encountered. If we are going to destination with high crosswinds/gusts forecast we need to put more fuel on board; I understand that costs money but it is the only ballast we can add to the aircraft at this time for increased weight. I might be totally off base but if that gust had been stronger; or if the crosswind more to the left; I really don't want to think about what might have happened. I feel this issue should be addressed/highlighted. Also; the fact that it happens after a redeye when you've been up all night and are not 100% further compounds the issue. The aircraft is a handful at TOGA and such light weights. Added vigilance is a must.  We are operating at low weights due to pandemic and low passenger counts; lower than ever before. It is still within legal limits obviously but I feel my situation shows how combination of environment both for pilot and aircraft; and these lower weights warrants highlighting extra vigilance when encountering this combination of factors.\nOn final approach below 500 feet AGL; encountered a wind gust that caused an unstable approach so we initiated a go around. After completing go around actions; I advised Tower that we were going around. They instructed us to maintain 3;000 feet and runway heading and to contact Departure. This call was made at about 2;000 feet. We were in go around pitch and TOGA power combined with the light weight of the aircraft [which] caused a high rate of climb; so the 1;000 feet from the instruction to the level off point happened very quickly. I advised the pilot flying that we were already passing 3;000 feet and had to level off. The pilot flying acknowledged and returned to the assigned altitude of 3;000 feet. Maximum deviation was 700 feet high.

	["Roughly 10-12 miles from Runway X; ZZZ Approach directed us to switch to the tower frequency after clearing us for a visual approach. The Pilot not Flying; my Captain; switched the pre-dialed in frequency for the Tower and called. I do not remember hearing a response as we continued our pre-landing checklist.As Pilot Flying I was focusing on hand-flying the precision approach and responding to this pre-landing checklist. Due to the recent slowdown in flying; I felt it prudent that I hand-fly this precision approach to keep my skills up. All of my attention was on the flying.In the past month I have flown less than 15 hours and then only very sporadically. The last day of flying prior to today was over two weeks ago and was with the same Captain.The landing was uneventful and as we were exiting the runway; the Pilot Not Flying called 'Clear of Runway X at taxiway.' We did not hear a response. Pilot Not Flying tried again; and it was at this moment I realized that we were not on the correct Tower frequency and dialed in the correct frequency.Pilot Not Flying had mistakenly dialed in ZZZ1 Tower Frequency instead of ZZZ Frequency. We realized that we had landed without a landing clearance. We promptly contacted the tower and admitted our mistake.I believe the contributing factors in this event were lack of recent flying + landing at night after a long day and a long flight.Corrective actions for this would be to pay closer attention to radio calls by Pilot Not Flying while acting as Pilot Flying and to ensure that we are given proper landing clearance before commencing landing. It is especially important to be extra vigilant when you are not as current as you are normally.\nWe were switched over to ZZZ Tower; but I inadvertently switched to frequency; which is ZZZ1; one of our previous stops that day. I checked in; and did not immediately get a response; so I continued with the checklist. We completed the checklist and did what we have done hundreds of times before landed. I called the tower to see if we could take Runway X for taxi; and of course; got no response. I called a second time; which was when my First Officer noticed that we were on the wrong frequency. We switched in; and the Tower asked us if we had heard them. We admitted our mistake and continued on.The takeaway is you can't let even an important thing like the checklist distract you from completing all of the required tasks in front of you. A contributing factor is that this was my third flight in over a month because of a massive slowdown in activity due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

	["A chain of events culminated in a rejected takeoff that likely would have resulted in a low level in flight engine failure had the takeoff been continued. The mission was to deliver Aircraft X on amphibious floats to ZZZZ. With the current coronavirus restrictions; most flights have been canceled. Our originally planned flight that morning was canceled and we therefore had to reschedule on a flight much earlier in the day that gave the Pilot In Command (PIC) limited time to rest. He later disclosed after this event that he had gone to sleep [for only 2 hours]. I had gotten about 6 hours of sleep the night before and napped on the flight down. The PIC has over 600 hours of [Aircraft X type] experience and lots of amphibian experience. I have a lot of experience on amphibious floats in aircraft such as Super Cubs. I had never flown a [Aircraft X type]; and therefore was unable to obtain insurance for the trip. My turboprop experience was limited to agricultural planes. However; I was required to go along since I have a [foreign] pilot's license for the flight portion in ZZZZ.When we arrived to the FBO (Fixed Base Operator); we were told the fuel truck was finishing on other aircraft. As as a result; the PIC stated he was tired and need to take a nap. While he slept in the FBO; I went out to the aircraft to sort out the cargo and also familiarize myself with the cockpit setup. I re-arranged the cargo and secured it in the heat; and then began to pre-flight according to the POH. I also familiarized myself with the inertial separator bypass handle; including a function check; but did not know what it did. I spent about an hour on the pre-flight; including pumping water out of the floats and cleaning the windshield. I was distracted several times throughout the pre-flight by the fuelers asking about the tanks; and then having to reference the POH since I was unfamiliar with the fuel system. The sun was high in the sky; and therefore difficult to see the aircraft from below. There was no reference to the cowling inlet plugs in any of the conversations with the customer or pre-flight checklist. They were black and flush with the cowling. The propeller was also partially blocking them; and with the sun conditions it was difficult to see them. Additionally; they could not be seen from the position of the floats and when I eventually removed them; required quite a bit of stretching forward to get to.After the PIC woke up; he came out to hand me the suitcases. I loaded those into the plane. We began the pre-flight procedures. It became quickly apparent that the PIC was a little unfamiliar with the plane; since it had been so long since he flew [Aircraft X type]. I went over the checklist with him and showed him the location of all switches since I had spent the previous hour going over it by myself. We then started the airplane normally. The first sign of trouble was the standby power system; which was showing it was on; likely due to low generator output. After performing a function check per the checklist; the problem seemed to go away when we gave it power. The PIC selected the handle out of feather and into high RPM; with the condition lever in high idle. The RPMs failed to come up into the green. He said that something was wrong; but I wrongly insisted that the [other type reporter fly's] always required a lot of gas in order to come out of feather. We laughed about it; shrugged it off; and finally gave it enough power to taxi out. In hindsight; I shouldn't have offered my professional input for a plane I had no experience in; since I didn't know what normal looks like.During the run up; more signs of trouble showed themselves. The runup was normal except that the internal reference bypass test was unable to be performed due to the handle being completely jammed. He went to turn the handle and I assumed that he just wasn't familiar with it since I had tested it earlier. I then went to turn it and it was completely jammed.Instead of taking a step back to see what the problem could have been; he said that he is OK with continuing as long as the bypass is in and locked; the normal position for flight. We were both tired; very sweaty; and under pressure from the customer; and agreed that it would probably be OK in the normal position. However; I didn't know what this system even was and what effect it had on the system. We started the takeoff roll and immediately noticed climbing ITT [interstage turbine] temperatures close to the limit. The PIC said 'this isn't right; the torque is low; but we can continue the takeoff' The torque was around 18 or so; whereas normal takeoff is around 25. ITTs were close to limit; and prop RPM was up. I didn't know what was normal and so I had no frame of reference. About halfway down the runway and just over 70 knots; we realized something wasn't normal. I had never taken off in [Aircraft X type]; and although I knew they had a lot of performance; I was merely comparing us to how a fully loaded [aircraft pilot is familiar with] would handle; which can be a dog even with all the power. The PIC decided with my concurrence to abort the takeoff and stopped with about 2000ft remaining. I announced that we were aborting; and the aircraft on final was given go around instructions. We pulled off the runway at which time we were searching the gauges desperately for an answer. I then saw very low oil pressure; still with limits; and temperature was very high. I then realized the problem; that the engine wasn't getting air; and had him shut down to avoid any damage since adding power to taxi was getting us close to maximum ITT. I stepped out on the floats and pulled the cowling plugs out. They were still snug in their position. The spinner and prop didn't touch them. They were dull black on the outside and flush. They were still intact; nothing was sucked into the engine. We filled out paperwork with airport rescue vehicles. I stated the reason for the abort was abnormal engine indications; which proved to be correct. The pressure imposed on the inertial separator from the cowling plugs covering air intake caused it to warp and cave in; jamming the door partially open. This is why the handle wouldn't move - the door was jammed. We had the airplane towed to maintenance; where a new inertial separator was ordered; a quite expensive lesson to learn. The mechanics said the damage likely happened immediately after startup. However; the bigger lesson here was that 2 several thousand hour professional pilots;having flown over 120 different types of aircraft each; with several heavy jet type ratings; foreign licenses; and airline PIC experience nearly caused an in-flight engine failure despite having multiple indications of a possible problem. Had we continued that takeoff; the engine would have over-temped and quit over downtown [city]. Although this could be blamed on something as simple as missing a pre-flight item; the bigger problem is that fatigue and distractions combined with inexperience and a willingness to take unnecessary risk nearly led to disaster. In the future; I will be careful to not justify things that are abnormal in areas that I'm unaware of; and never continue the flight when a pre-flight check shows a failed item; especially on a system I don't know anything about.", {"entities": [[4212, 4220, "WEATHER"], [5414, 5422, "WEATHER"], [5447, 5458, "WEATHER"], [6047, 6055, "WEATHER"], [34, 50, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [108, 114, "AIRPLANE"], [131, 138, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [836, 841, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1043, 1048, "CREW"], [1098, 1105, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1113, 1116, "ABBREVIATION"], [1124, 1128, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1291, 1294, "ABBREVIATION"], [1382, 1389, "AIRPLANE"], [1467, 1477, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1495, 1498, "ABBREVIATION"], [1657, 1667, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1728, 1738, "AIRPLANE"], [1786, 1796, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1869, 1872, "ABBREVIATION"], [2102, 2112, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2172, 2181, "AIRPLANE"], [2537, 2547, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2675, 2679, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3479, 3483, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4406, 4413, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4443, 4451, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4468, 4475, "AIRPLANE"], [4585, 4592, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4641, 4648, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4799, 4805, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4879, 4888, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5020, 5025, "CREW"], [5151, 5158, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5182, 5188, "ALTITUDE"], [5271, 5280, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5313, 5319, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5512, 5518, "AIRPLANE"], [5886, 5892, "AIRPLANE"], [5995, 6001, "AIRPLANE"], [6176, 6180, "AIRPLANE"], [6240, 6244, "AIRPLANE"], [6286, 6297, "CREW"], [6543, 6548, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6701, 6707, "AIRPLANE"], [6797, 6804, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6810, 6816, "AIRPLANE"], [6937, 6947, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7240, 7250, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["While the event does not meet the accident/incident reporting requirements of NTSB; this report may be of some value to other pilots.Aventura amphibious (flying boat) 2-seat single engine piston EAB in pusher prop configuration; with electric repositionable landing gear.After water-landing in a local pond; I returned to the airport area. Upon announcing on CTAF my plan to enter the downwind another pilot offered to extend his takeoff leg prior to entering a crosswind and downwind. I (unnecessarily) expedited my pattern to minimize inconvenience to the other pilot; and in the process failed to lower my landing gear (resulting in far more inconvenience). My aircraft's fiberglass hull skidded across the runway surface; leaving a line of white dust. This incident was a direct result of my failure to use the landing checklist; a checklist that is committed to memory and also printed on my panel! After coming to a stop and realizing what had happened; I notified pilots in the air via CTAF to not land on this runway and asked the FBO for assistance. I exited the aircraft to assess damage to the aircraft and to determine how to best to exit the runway.Damage to the aircraft was minimal and the aircraft is in a condition for safe flight. I was asked not to move the aircraft until given the go-ahead from the FSDO. During the approximately 30-45 minute wait; I walked the runway to verify that there was no damage to the runway surface and to verify that the incident had not deposited any FOD.

It was getting late in the day and we were under pressure to get the aircraft back to the FBO before dark since these were newly acquired aircraft that haven't flown in several years. The helicopter approached the formation from the right at the same altitude. Focusing on the lead aircraft; I did not observe the helicopter until close proximity. I immediately initiated a diving right turn to avoid a collision with the helicopter losing approximately 200 ft. The helicopter took no evasive action and flew right between me and the lead aircraft in the formation. I immediately climbed back to 1500 ft. and rejoined the formation. I radioed the lead aircraft and informed him of the situation and asked if he received any alert from ATC since we were under flight following. He replied 'negative'.

	["During climb; First Officer and I noticed and discussed a strong burning smell wondering if something was burning in one of the ovens. Right after that Flight Attendant called to report a strong burning smell. I asked if anything was in the ovens and she replied no and she would investigate and call back. Shortly she called and said the smell could not be identified but appeared to be coming from the air ducts. First Officer and I discussed it briefly and I advised her we would return for landing with 10 minutes remaining in flight and a normal landing. First Officer continued as flying pilot with autopilot engaged and managed programming the FMC for a return to ZZZ. I ran the smoke fire fumes checklist; used ACARS for sending the divert message; and continued communication with ATC including [requesting priority handling]. While running the checklist we decided the oxygen masks were not needed. Then we completed the normal checklists. I made a brief PA to the passengers. We noticed the off-schedule descent light and noted we were returning to the departure field taking no further action on that light with consideration of being on approach. I asked if First Officer was good to continue as flying pilot through the landing and he completed a nice landing.\nOn climbout from ZZZ; I noticed a burning smell. I confirmed with Captain that he smelled something awry; a bit less acrid that an electrical fire smell; but definitely not a smell associated with normal operations. We both wondered aloud if perhaps the flight attendants had left something in the oven and perhaps it was burning. I was the Pilot Flying and about this time the Purser called and Captain spoke with her. I could overhear that Captain was discussing the smell with the Purser. He passed along that both the flight attendants and the passengers could smell something burning as well. Captain asked the purser to have a look at the galley areas and the lavatories. The Purser reported back that they could not find anything burning but nevertheless still smelled the odor. During this time Captain and I discussed returning to ZZZ. To me; the odor was gone/dissipated; but we agreed that an air return was the best option. I remained the Pilot Flying while Captain did the initial coordination with ATC. He described the situation to ATC and I started on vectors to return to ZZZ for the ILS. ATC then queried whether we were going to [request priority handling] and Captain replied in the affirmative. I continued with autopilot as we were vectored for the approach. I reprogrammed the FMC for the approach while Captain ran the smoke/fume/fire checklist. At this point we had considered donning masks/regulators but I believed that in the time-compressed environment on short approach that masks/regulators presented a threat of distraction and loss of situational awareness. We mitigated the threat by leaving the masks stowed with no visible indication of smoke/fire and with the fumes dissipated on the flight deck. The ACARS diversion option populated at I programmed the ARR and queried Captain if he had notified Dispatch yet. Sure enough; he already had. I then verified the NAVAIDS/COURSE/MINS and quickly briefed the approach as we were on dogleg to final. Captain made a PA announcement to the passengers to assuage any concerns about firetrucks/first responders on rollout. We then discussed clearing the runway after landing which we both agreed was the best course of action. We got the 'off scheduled descent' light but pressed without performing that checklist due to our position on the approach; noting that we were returning to our departure field. We were pushed to the single frequency approach frequency and I remained the pilot flying and configured around 10-12 DME. Captain ran the landing checklist and we landed uneventfully; transferred aircraft control with idle reverse and cleared the runway.

	["I reached out to the First Officer a week prior to the trip and we had a brief discussion to schedule a meeting in order to discuss the upcoming IOE training. We met at my hangar and I went over a lot of the items on the OE/Requal checklist. I felt it was important to get some work done ahead of time as the [early morning] departure to ZZZ is a very difficult start time to manage with any kind of rest. I made a point to brief the areas of vulnerabilities for both ZZZ1 and ZZZ. These are arguably two of the more challenging airports we fly to; primarily because of the high field elevation. I debated for a long time whether I should fly both legs. I ultimately decided there is was no way I would let a new pilot with zero heavy jet experience land in ZZZ1. The weather in ZZZ was good; clear with no wind; so I felt this would be the acceptable option to begin the training.  We met one hour prior to departure and went over the flight paperwork and expectations for the flight. Arriving at the aircraft; preflight; and engine start were normal. Taxi out and takeoff as well as cruise phase and the descent into the ZZZ area were all fine. As part of the landing briefing; I made a point to cover the difference landing at a high elevation airport over a normal elevation airport. I told the First Officer it was important to flare at 30 feet instead of the normal 20 feet. We discussed the auto throttles and whether to leave them engaged or not. I told him I preferred to leave them engaged; but not to let them come to idle at 30 feet. I emphasized he could still push the throttles with the auto throttles engaged. I told him we should leave some power in until well established in the flare or when the wheels touch down. We were cleared for the visual approach and descended to 7000 feet. We had some difficulty intercepting the final approach course as we rolled out too early and were approximately a half mile left of the course. Now we were going past the glide slope intercept point and were getting slightly high on the path. I instructed the First Officer to disengage the autopilot and manually fly the aircraft. We were able to make all necessary flight path corrections and meet stabilized approach well prior to 1000 feet. The First Officer began his flare at 50 feet. This was slightly higher than the 30 feet we briefed. I told him to add power and he complied. I felt a sink rate develop around 20 feet and I exerted slight aft pressure on the yoke to cushion the touchdown. We were exactly on the approach speed of 135 knots; so I felt we had plenty of energy to work with. I think he felt the pressure I put on the yoke and he abruptly snatched the yoke aft just as the wheels touched down. The aircraft rapidly pitched up as the aircraft bounced. I felt the bounce was serious and immediately initiated a go around. I saw he was moving to deploy the reversers and I pushed his hands away and made sure the reversers remained stowed while I pushed the throttles to Max and hit the TOGA switches. The go around; pattern and subsequent landing were all normal. I filled out the logbook and made the appropriate phone calls. I felt we were in an extremely dangerous situation and recovering the landing was not an option.\nDuring the first leg of my OE; I was the flying pilot on the visual approach to RWY XXR at ZZZ backed up with the ILS. I was hand flying the approach with autothrottles engaged.  The approach was stabilized and at approximately 200 ft AGL I added a small amount of thrust to maintain speed given the high airport elevation. Between 50 ft and 30 ft I began to initiate a flare and at some point; shortly thereafter; the Captain added back pressure on the control wheel to counter what he felt was an increase in sink rate. The wheels touched down firmly and there was a perceived bounce. The Captain immediately took over the aircraft controls and initiated a go-around to avoid a second touchdown. The Captain flew the go-around and traffic pattern to a normal landing and we taxied to the ramp with no further issues. After a maintenance inspection; it was determined the aircraft did not suffer a hard landing or any damage; but the tail skid plate had contacted the runway. This was my first approach and landing in the actual aircraft and I believe the high airport elevation was a factor in aircraft control.", {"entities": [[768, 775, "WEATHER"], [807, 811, "WEATHER"], [2455, 2463, "WEATHER"], [2622, 2630, "WEATHER"], [3686, 3694, "WEATHER"], [21, 34, "CREW"], [172, 178, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [541, 544, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [639, 642, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [713, 718, "CREW"], [750, 754, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [986, 994, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1012, 1021, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1027, 1033, "AIRPLANE"], [1066, 1073, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1085, 1091, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1106, 1113, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1299, 1312, "CREW"], [1342, 1349, "ALTITUDE"], [1372, 1379, "ALTITUDE"], [1537, 1544, "ALTITUDE"], [1758, 1773, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1778, 1787, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1791, 1800, "ALTITUDE"], [1842, 1856, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2062, 2075, "CREW"], [2093, 2102, "AIRPLANE"], [2116, 2119, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2213, 2221, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2236, 2245, "ALTITUDE"], [2251, 2264, "CREW"], [2284, 2291, "ALTITUDE"], [2327, 2334, "ALTITUDE"], [2422, 2429, "ALTITUDE"], [2471, 2475, "AIRPLANE"], [2491, 2500, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2525, 2533, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2644, 2648, "AIRPLANE"], [2678, 2682, "AIRPLANE"], [3010, 3014, "ABBREVIATION"], [3040, 3047, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3289, 3295, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3296, 3301, "CREW"], [3309, 3324, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3328, 3331, "ABBREVIATION"], [3362, 3365, "ABBREVIATION"], [3378, 3384, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3389, 3397, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3431, 3439, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3476, 3482, "ALTITUDE"], [3483, 3486, "ABBREVIATION"], [3580, 3585, "ALTITUDE"], [3590, 3595, "ALTITUDE"], [3667, 3674, "CREW"], [3710, 3715, "AIRPLANE"], [3839, 3846, "CREW"], [3935, 3944, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3950, 3957, "CREW"], [3958, 3962, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3989, 3996, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4024, 4030, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4038, 4042, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4075, 4086, "CREW"], [4217, 4223, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4243, 4251, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["Upon initial approach to ITH; Elmira Approach Control issued a clearance for the ILS 32 into ITH from the CFB transition; cross CFB at or above 4000. When given the clearance; we were 3 NM from CFB. The approach was already briefed as radar vectors for the ILS by the CA/PF (Captain/Pilot Flying). I was asked to reload the approach in the FMS with the CFB transition; which was done on the CA side FMS. Once complete I cross filled the flight plan/approach to my side FMS. As PM (Pilot Monitoring) I became task saturated when the approach did not transfer correctly to my FMS and had to be re-sequenced appropriately. While this was occurring; CA queried me as to the altitude for the transition from CFB to OCCIE on the approach. Due to the proximity of the aircraft; small print on the approach plate; and speed of the events occurring; we both agreed our altitude was to be 3;000 ft. We had both misinterpreted the plate based on our location; and descended to 3;000 as opposed to the 3;400 for the transition. Once on final outside of IT outer marker; we received a LANDING GEAR GPWS warning due to a sharp rise in terrain at our location and aircraft configuration. The warning was brief. Prior to being handed off; Approach queried us on our altitude to which we responded 3;000. By that point we were VMC and had the runway in sight. Normal landing was made from that point. Identification: GPWS warning; CA and I both agreed after ATC query that we could have remained at 4000 until established on the final approach course and intercepted the GS from that altitude. This would have prevented the GPWS. Cause: ATC clearance for the full ILS 32 from CFB transition was issued in close proximity to CFB approaching ITH. Although the approach was briefed; we did not have the transition loaded correctly in the FMS. The combination of my distraction with reloading the procedure and cross fill error in the FMS along with rushed timing to do so lead to missed verification of the appropriate altitude for the segment of the approach. This later lead to a GPWS warning on the final approach course. Response: Interception of the GS was made and no further correction was needed. In hindsight; we agreed we could have requested vectors to the final as opposed to accepting the transition and it would have reduced workload and error at that point during the approach.", {"entities": [[5, 21, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [37, 45, "CREW"], [81, 84, "ABBREVIATION"], [106, 109, "ABBREVIATION"], [128, 131, "ABBREVIATION"], [186, 188, "ABBREVIATION"], [194, 197, "ABBREVIATION"], [203, 211, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [257, 260, "ABBREVIATION"], [268, 270, "ABBREVIATION"], [275, 282, "CREW"], [324, 332, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [340, 343, "ABBREVIATION"], [353, 356, "ABBREVIATION"], [391, 393, "ABBREVIATION"], [399, 402, "ABBREVIATION"], [449, 457, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [469, 472, "ABBREVIATION"], [532, 540, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [574, 577, "ABBREVIATION"], [646, 648, "ABBREVIATION"], [703, 706, "ABBREVIATION"], [723, 731, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [790, 798, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [879, 887, "ALTITUDE"], [953, 962, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1223, 1231, "CREW"], [1326, 1332, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1414, 1416, "ABBREVIATION"], [1441, 1444, "CREW"], [1512, 1526, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1554, 1556, "ABBREVIATION"], [1620, 1623, "CREW"], [1647, 1650, "ABBREVIATION"], [1659, 1662, "ABBREVIATION"], [1707, 1710, "ABBREVIATION"], [1711, 1722, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1741, 1749, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1818, 1821, "ABBREVIATION"], [1914, 1917, "ABBREVIATION"], [2031, 2039, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2082, 2096, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2135, 2137, "ABBREVIATION"], [2363, 2371, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

And this pick slip only had a remark saying 'This is needed for tonight;' and that's why I thought this was a regular part. Another thing we need to be careful of is where we get the part from. We have a special section for Hazmat parts in the stockroom; but this time the part was handed to me outside of that section.

	["F/O (First Officer) and I noticed a series of 'thumps' while in cruise at FL410. We suspected pressurization and noticed cabin climbing slowly at 500 fpm. Cabin did not stabilize and was just over 9000 feet. We decided to start a normal but rapid descent to a lower cruise altitude. We got the Cabin Altitude aural alert and warning light during the descent. Accomplished QRC/QRH; which required an emergency descent and deployment of cabin O2 masks. Notified ATC and got clearance to 14;000 feet. Passing about FL230 we noticed cabin was below 9000 feet and stable. We stopped descent at FL210 and diverted to ZZZ. Checked with F/As (Flight Attendants) to make sure there were no injuries and to advise that they and passengers could remove O2 masks. The rest of flight was uneventful. Preventative Measures: F/O suggested that we start down as soon as we saw the cabin climbing after the thumps. I wanted to see if cabin would stabilize since the rate was slow. If we started down earlier; we may have avoided the emergency descent/masks since the cabin stabilized at FL230.\nWe noticed a thumping/ vibrating sound. It sounded like something that had to do with pressure; as in an air pressure change in the aircraft. Associated with that noise was a cabin climb of about 500 fpm on the cabin rate of climb indicator. We were at 41;000 feet and had been discussing starting a descent as soon as we could; since the cabin was definitely climbing. We called Center and started our descent when the cabin reached about 9000 feet we were already on our way down. As we were descending through about FL390 the cabin reached 10;000 feet we donned our oxygen masks; went through the QRH; complied with the required items and continued our descent to 14;000 feet. ATC was great; they asked questions; but not in a rushed 'need an answer right this second' kind of way and were very helpful in our divert plan. Our cabin stabilized passing through 23;000 feet and was trending down to a lower cabin altitude. When things settled down; we talked to the flight attendants to make sure they were ok and get a status check on the passengers. The flight attendants were fantastic; definitely handled this event professionally and took care of passengers above and beyond. The passengers that we interacted with hardly seemed rattled or concerned at all; I feel this was likely due to how the cabin crew handled the situation.

It was far off the left wingtip of the aircraft; and we were moving much faster away from it than it could from us. The object was however close enough that I could see it was a man-made machine.While the black object was abeam the aircraft I could note it had the appearance of a drone. It appeared to be a drone that used rotors for flight. There was a light on it that appeared to have a yellowish tint. It appeared to maintain a constant altitude and move laterally on a linear plane.I have never owned or operated a drone; but from what I have seen from friends and on the internet it appeared to be a drone one would buy for personal use.

I began to pull back on the yoke more at the same time adding some power which made the problem worse with such a light airplane. We made a bounced landing and I decided to make a go-around. As I added power we might have lightly touched again; but made a successful go-around and clean up. After clean up the CA decided to make the landing on XY.\nApproaching ZZZ; weather was X00 OVC X miles Visibility and a slight tailwind. We did do a landing data assessment. Weather was good to accomplish a CAT III landing.  Airplane was very light due to approximately XX souls on board. FO flew [a] good approach. In the last 100 feet developed a higher sink rate. I told him to start pulling back on the yoke to break the descent. FO elected to add power at about 20 feet to break descent. This was a surprise to me. He added too much power for the circumstances. Due to the light weight the airplane accelerated forward; but still the main gear hit the runway firmly then immediately went airborne again. He pushed forward still trying to land the airplane but quickly realized a go-around was the correct thing to do so he initiated a go-around. During the go-around I believe the main gear kissed the runway again. I was in the process of taking the airplane; but he ended up doing a good go-around and I took the jet when we leveled off at 2;000 feet and I flew the rest of the flight and the landing to XY. The go-around was from XX.I should have emphasized to FO not [to] rely solely on the flare cue. My hesitation in saying that the visibility was not great and he may find the flare cue helpful.

The door switch was down and all lights on the center panel were out. However; I always go beyond the call of duty and push on the door from the inside to make sure it is closed. When I did so; the door came flying open. The metal door lock inside the frame was not locking. We MEL'd it with Maintenance and were told to use the manual lock instead.I have had this happen three times in my career where the door lock fails like this. I have filed reports about this problem before and nothing has been done to fix this safety threat with the way we do things here at Company. Our checklist tells us to look at the lights on the center panel to see if they are out. For some reason we seem to think those lights are telling us that the metal latch inside the door is actually working right; but that is wrong. That LOCK FAIL light is only telling me that [the] electrical power circuitry in the arming switch portion of the door is indicating that the Flight Deck Access System Switch is off; or the flight deck door has failed to lock. However; we have seen that it does not always detect a failed door lock working properly. We have seen that flight deck doors come open with the LOCK FAIL light and the AUTO UNLK lights both out and the arming switch is in the downed position. Nowhere in our procedures does it tell a Pilot to physically push on the door from inside the flight deck to double check to make sure the lock is actually working; to make sure the door does not fly open. About 90 percent of the time Flight Attendants do not check the door or forget to flip the switch down when they close the door. I have caught many times that the door was not locked properly by just pushing on it and having it come open.

	["It has been nearly a month without any Initial Operating Experience flights.  I understand there is no requirement which defines the amount of time between completion of simulator training/operating experience; check-ride and starting (or completing OE). However; I am very concerned about my diminishing level of proficiency starting IOE.Over the course of the last month (due to the COVID-19 crisis) the flight schedule has become so restrictive that the OE schedulers have been unable to execute many plans they have constructed for my flights and those of my classmates.  I suspect the significant delays also extend to other classes waiting to complete IOE; as well as transitioning pilots needing to complete OE.  LCA (Line Check Airman) availability has likely been further affected by other factors. Beyond completion of OE; I expect the schedule restrictions will delay consolidation as well. Although an FAA extension to the consolidation timeline will put an administrative fix on that particular issue; it does nothing to assist with the retention of skills and knowledge.", {"entities": [[688, 694, "CREW"], [914, 917, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

I was told by the agent and the ZZZ supervisor that this entire shipment of 56;928 lbs. consisting of 11 PMC pallet boards and the 3 carts of bulk were from the same shipper (who bought the entire aircraft for this charter) and was 1 single AWB. The supervisor stated that there is a 'flaw' in [software] that they had been fighting for a while that with only 1 AWB all the cargo would be considered HAZMAT because it sees it as a single shipment (shipper loaded) I was told that the shipper separated any non-Hazmat into the carts. I advised them to contact the cargo help desk for assistance.

	["During the climb out of ZZZZ we got a Master Caution '>Autopilot' on the EICAS. At the time the right autopilot was connected; and in LNAV and VNAV modes. There was no autopilot disconnect; and there were no FMA mode flags. We noted the issue; looked at what the QRH had to say; and continued. We decided that the best thing to do was monitor the situation.We leveled at 8000 ft. and began getting 'direct to' clearances that shorten the distance from ZZZZ to ZZZZ1. We had begun a descent that put us in a good position to land in ZZZZ1; but then our route was cut much shorter than anticipated. We were cleared to descend to 3000 ft. on a heading of 220. I had called for flaps 5; and had the speed brakes extended in FLCH mode to help get us down a little quicker. The speed bug was down between Vref for flaps 1 and 5 with the flaps extended (not in transit) to Flaps 5. Passing about 4500 ft. in the turn to heading 220 we were given further turn to 280; and cleared for the ILS approach. We do not have a chart for the ILS approach to that runway and were shooting a VFR approach; and the Captain was stating this to the controller to get a clearance for the visual approach - consistent with the limited information available for this airport in [software].I was looking at the heading window; dialing heading 280 when the Captain called out that we were approaching a speed that would overspeed the flaps. I stopped; looked at the PFD (Primary Flight Display) to assess the situation that had suddenly developed; and my first impulse was to change the vertical mode to V/S to shallow the descent in order to slow the airplane; in the 1-2 seconds that I had moved my hand to carry out that change the Captain began saying 'Pull up! Pull up! Disconnect the autopilot and pull up!' I looked back at the PFD; saw that we were at the high speed cue; and descending through 3000 ft. The Flight Director had captured the altitude. 'ALT' was displayed on the FMA. There were no FMA mode flags. It appeared that the autopilot had stopped following the Flight Director guidance; and may have pitched down further. I disconnected the autopilot and recovered the aircraft to straight and level flight as quickly as I felt I could without over stressing the wing. We had descended to roughly 2300 ft. Throughout the recovery the Flight Director showed guidance to maintain 3000 ft.There was some discussion as to whether we should attempt to climb back to 3000; or continue the approach from our present position. At 2300 ft. we were just slightly low on the approach. We were established on our straight-in course to the runway; and I had heard cleared for the approach at some point in the preceding few seconds. We confirmed our approach clearance; and continued the approach to a landing at ZZZZ1.Once we shut down the aircraft we wrote up the autopilot as not functioning correctly because it failed to follow the Flight Director guidance. We could find no reason why it would've stopped following the Flight Director guidance prior to the event; and believed that the autopilot malfunction was the cause of the event.This event highlights how rapidly a situation can develop. The only times my eyes were off the PFD were when I had them on the Mode Control Panel to control the autopilot. What I saw on the PFD when I looked back had me believing I must have been distracted for a significant time for this to develop; but I know that is not true. It developed within just a couple of seconds; and this was confirmed by the other pilots who didn't believe that I had missed anything.The situation got to the point that it did because of a turn clearance that came at the exact moment that the autopilot stopped following the Flight Director; and it occurred right around the time that we would call 1000 ft. to level off. We all know this 1000 ft. is a critical time; and our crew was paying attention. It highlights that even when we're doing everything right; something canquickly develop.As the pilot flying my mind went into an upset recovery mode for a few moments. The aircraft attitude was not outside the normal pitch or roll limitations; but I saw and treated this as a recovery in which I temporarily ignored route and altitude clearances until I was confident the plane was recovered to straight and level. This mentality was not easy to leave as we continued to the landing. In the future I will probably ask that we discontinue the approach for a few moments to ensure everyone in the cockpit (including myself) is ready to continue to the landing. To be roughly on glide path at 2300 ft. meant that when we recovered and continued to landing we were at least nearing an 8 mile final; and because of the issue we had to continue to move with purpose to continue that approach from a Flaps 5 configuration to being stable and configured at 1000 ft. Taking a moment to slow the tempo down after that event would've been a better course to take.\nOn climb out just before level off at 8000 ft. (short flight; final cruise altitude) we received an 'auto pilot' caution message. I was the Pilot Monitoring and we went over the QRH (advisory QRH; no action) The Pilot Flying was advised that per QRH the Autopilot was working at degraded mode. The autopilot seems to work properly tracking L nav and leveling off at 8000 ft. and holding altitude properly. I asked the Pilot Flying to pay extra attention to the autopilot. Shortly afterward; we were descending to 3000 (FLCh mode) and on a turn towards the airport for visual approach. At 3000 ft. I called altitude and airspeed. I noticed [the] airplane wasn't leveling and airspeed actually accelerating towards flaps 5 limits. I called the Pilot Flying to disconnect the autopilot and pitch up to return to altitude and to prevent flaps over speed. We recovered around 2600 ft. and climbed back to 3000 ft. without exceeding AFM limitation (G loads and flaps over speed).We continue to [our] destination for a visual approach followed by a normal approach and landing. At the gate we entered [the] discrepancy in [the] aircraft logbook. Maintenance could not duplicate issues after test and diagnostic.This was a short flight with [a] high workload and ATC barrier. Even though this was a high workload environment. As a crew; we should have disconnected the autopilot and hand flown the airplane or use another autopilot. Pilot flying should have paid more attention to the airplane and so should have I (Pilot Monitoring).I hope we can add a note in the QRH to try and connect [the] other autopilot even if the current one looks like it's doing a good job.", {"entities": [[11, 16, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [73, 78, "AIRPLANE"], [102, 111, "AIRPLANE"], [143, 147, "ABBREVIATION"], [168, 177, "AIRPLANE"], [263, 266, "ABBREVIATION"], [371, 378, "ALTITUDE"], [482, 489, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [524, 528, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [616, 623, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [627, 634, "ALTITUDE"], [889, 896, "ALTITUDE"], [980, 992, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1025, 1037, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1046, 1052, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1073, 1076, "ABBREVIATION"], [1077, 1085, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1095, 1102, "CREW"], [1165, 1180, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1293, 1299, "AIRPLANE"], [1330, 1337, "CREW"], [1362, 1373, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1596, 1603, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1708, 1715, "CREW"], [1763, 1772, "AIRPLANE"], [1857, 1867, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1876, 1883, "ALTITUDE"], [2015, 2024, "AIRPLANE"], [2131, 2140, "AIRPLANE"], [2253, 2257, "AIRPLANE"], [2266, 2275, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2287, 2294, "ALTITUDE"], [2368, 2375, "ALTITUDE"], [2437, 2442, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2473, 2481, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2512, 2519, "ALTITUDE"], [2554, 2562, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2617, 2623, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2657, 2665, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2727, 2735, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2765, 2773, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2843, 2852, "AIRPLANE"], [3069, 3078, "AIRPLANE"], [3279, 3288, "AIRPLANE"], [3531, 3537, "CREW"], [3694, 3703, "AIRPLANE"], [3800, 3807, "ALTITUDE"], [3840, 3847, "ALTITUDE"], [3999, 4004, "CREW"], [4005, 4011, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4446, 4454, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4499, 4506, "AIRPLANE"], [4594, 4601, "ALTITUDE"], [4649, 4656, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4781, 4789, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4853, 4860, "ALTITUDE"], [4960, 4965, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4995, 5002, "ALTITUDE"], [5025, 5031, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5063, 5068, "CREW"], [5135, 5138, "ABBREVIATION"], [5149, 5152, "ABBREVIATION"], [5203, 5206, "ABBREVIATION"], [5255, 5264, "AIRPLANE"], [5323, 5330, "ALTITUDE"], [5336, 5343, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5381, 5387, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5418, 5427, "AIRPLANE"], [5456, 5466, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5525, 5540, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5545, 5552, "ALTITUDE"], [5705, 5711, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5730, 5739, "AIRPLANE"], [5828, 5835, "ALTITUDE"], [5841, 5848, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5857, 5864, "ALTITUDE"], [5969, 5984, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6006, 6014, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6035, 6039, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6096, 6107, "CREW"], [6212, 6215, "CREW"], [6318, 6327, "AIRPLANE"], [6337, 6342, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6371, 6380, "AIRPLANE"], [6515, 6518, "ABBREVIATION"], [6550, 6559, "AIRPLANE"]]}],

	["We were told that our assigned aircraft had changed. We now had Aircraft X [on the ground] and [an inspection aircraft] still scheduled to arrive [a few hours later].

During the inspection we found the L/H aft Position light inop and an MEL for galley drawer we needed parts for. We went to grab parts for Mel and light. During this time [another aircraft] returned to a gate for PSEU [Proximity Switch Electronic Unit] light on. The Lead asked for anyone available to answer the call. After the second request AMT2 [Aircraft Maintenance Tech 2] and I decided to answer the gate return. We were able to fix the PSEU light and [the] aircraft was able to continue its flight though it took a little longer than planned. We got back to Aircraft X; we fixed the L/H position light and galley MEL and began working the FIM. The FIM asked us to apply brakes and observe the piston actuation and retractions if no problems were observed the fault was transitory. We called Maintenance Control to clear the MEL and report our findings on the brake dragging. Maintenance Control asked us to perform an additional task of jacking both gears of the aircraft and physically spin all 4 Main Landing Gear tires. So we went to get the landing gear jack and brought it to the aircraft and jacked the R/H landing gear first. While spinning the wheels we found the #3 grinding and not spinning freely. I started to prep for tire and brake removal. AMT2 went to go get the torque wrenches and thread/axle protectors we would need to change the #3 brakes. We felt we had to have the brake changed and aircraft ready to fly before our [next] check aircraft arrived because we did not know how long it would take to complete the check and if we could make it back out to Aircraft X. We changed the brake [about 10 minutes before the next aircraft was scheduled to arrive] and when we torqued the tire back on and we still needed to jack the LH side as soon as the tire was on and secured. We lowered the gear and I went to jack the left side while AMT2 installed dust cover. I jacked and spun the left gear and found them spinning freely.

While still in the right hand turn; the compass was holding due south and was not moving at all. I consulted ATC and got no assistance; but rather told that I was 'incompetent and couldn't follow directions'.

	["Flight was a morning repositioning flight from ZZZ to SBP. [I] used self brief and a call to Flight Service to determine if clouds in SoCal were a solid deck or layers as icing was a factor. In discussions with the briefer the briefer commented that the Graphical Forecasts for Aviation tool showed both solid clouds and layers and that it was purely computer generated. I lamented the loss of the area forecast and asked for pireps; but none were available. I attempted to get on top by climbing to 12000 ft. and that worked until just E of PMD VOR. Initial entry into IMC produced no ice due to very little moisture and was able to receive vectors around radar returns of moisture. At some point north of RZS VOR; I picked up trace rime ice and noted an indicated airspeed decay and based on aircraft performance; suspected pitot ice. I cross-referenced indicated altitude with GPS altitude and ensured it was reliable. Not too long after that I experienced a downdraft and countered with pitch; unfortunately it was enough that I got down below Vs and was mushing downhill in a power on stall with no airspeed indicator. I told LA Center I was unable to maintain altitude and requested 10k; and set about -700VSI in order to get airspeed back and level at 10. This worked until another downdraft repeated the problem; I was able to get it leveled back at approx 9600 ft. and ATC issued an altitude alert for MVA; I had already selected the terrain display on the GPS. LA handed me off to Santa Barbara Approach who had lower MVAs and I was able to stabilize at about 9000 ft. Uneventful recovery via RNAV 29 at SBP and the airspeed came back to life at about 200 ft. AGL.Bring back the area forecast. The meteorologists narrative on flight conditions beats a computer model. Decision to take off into suspect icing with an unclear forecast and no PIREPS was foolhardy for an aircraft not FIKI equipped. Loss of reliable airspeed is worthy of advising ATC; not just recognizing and dealing with it. Not wanting to divert to an airport I hadn't prepared for; in IMC was the rationale; but again; poor. LA Center did a fantastic job of getting me to Santa Barbara approach as early as possible to get [a] lower MVA and he had briefed the Approach Controller who was ready with a vector and an altitude.In both my airline and military careers we train to unreliable airspeed but we usually do so where the aircraft has plenty of performance margin. I owned this plane for 3+ years and knew what the indicators of decreasing airspeed were without an indicator but at 12k; (which is as high as I've ever flown it and near the service ceiling) there wasn't any more power to add to arrest the descent from a downdraft. Fortunately I have flown that plane deep into stalls and knew that's what was happening. I let the new owner know the pitot heater is INOP and recommended he install a separate ammeter or indicator light to show the pitot heater is energized. Because of the static sources aft on the fuselage; there were no static pressure problems.The decision not to fly was clearly missed. Pitot heaters should have some indicator of operational status. Training to know pitch and power settings for flight is a glorious thing but it's never done at the edge of the performance envelope. AoA gauge here would have made this a non-event IF it was installed in an icing resistant position. (Heated vane or pressure ports on top and bottom of wing well aft of leading edge.

	["The callsign conflict was missed -- in my opinion -- as the result of two circumstances.  First; I am still working on developing a workflow.  Although I do have significant Dispatch experience; my coming up to speed in systems familiarization still has me with a handicap in reviewing potential conflict. Second; the workload for company employees as the result of significant cancellations; schedule adjustments; and non-scheduled flying as the direct result of the COVID-19 circumstances is requiring increased schedule activity.  The resulting delays; reposition flights; extreme biohazard precautions within the offices and other company property...are all responsible for degrading the inherent stability otherwise found in well-established systems and in the best practice of dispatching.  Communication -- while still required -- must be remote and minimized.Corrective action:  It is my opinion the only course of action which would have prevented this occurrence is tighter communication.  I do believe that if the ATC coordinators; Dispatch coordinators; and dispatchers were free to openly and routinely communicate as enjoyed in the past (absent COVID-19); and the situation were moot; we likely would not have had a callsign conflict.

We were taxiing down the only taxiway at the ZZZ when half way down the taxiway; the plane violently pivoted left toward one of the private hangar homes adjacent to the taxi-way. It felt as if I had taxied into a large hole. I applied full braking and killed the engine. When the plane came to a stop; my friend asked what had happened. I looked out the left window and saw a white pickup truck parked with all 4 wheels on the taxiway. I saw that the last 1/8th of my left wing had collided with the front windshield of the pickup truck. As I examined the damage to the wing; I saw that the wing tip was ripped off and the sheet metal and internal structure of the last 1/8 of the wing was torn and crumpled.ZZZ is a small; private airport and I had used that same taxiway only 20 minutes prior. There was no other traffic using the pattern or moving on the ground. As I taxied; I was looking right down the middle of the taxiway; focusing on staying on centerline. The pickup truck was parked on the taxiway and displayed no warning lights or markers and there were no NOTAMS for taxiway obstructions. The truck was white and blended into the background. After the collision; neither my friend or I knew what we hit.

	["We have an old PFD/MFD system made by a brand named Chelton. We have had numerous minor failures or malfunctions with this system; mainly related to GPS navigation. Some of the other pilots at my base along with myself have brought this system up as a safety concern in the past to others in our company. Repairs have been attempted at least once; but these problems with the Cheltons persist.

Rather; the standby Attitude Indicator is displayed on the MFD screen directly below the PFD. This standby AI (Attitude Indicator) is displayed on the MFD by simply pressing a knob on the lower right-hand corner of that display. This standby Attitude Indicator was still functioning normally when the Primary one failed.For part of our patient-loaded leg from ZZZ to ZZZ1; the AI on the PFD gave erroneous readings; showing the aircraft in approximately a 35 degree bank to the right when the aircraft was actually in straight and level flight; and giving an audible; 'Attitude failure; attitude failure' warning. On our return leg after dropping off the patient; the PFD continuously and erratically cycled through 3 or 4 different displays; including: a correct indication of our attitude and upcoming terrain; the same right-hand bank attitude; a red 'X' in the middle of the screen; and a display where the half of the screen above the horizon was brown instead of blue. Each display would show for 2 or 3 seconds; then go to a different display. This continued for the entire flight back. I did not find a way to stop the display from doing this. Along with the visual abnormality; the audible female voice saying; 'Attitude failure; attitude failure' repeated continuously the whole flight back.I did not put the item on MEL until the following day after ferrying the aircraft to ZZZ2 to be repaired. This was to prevent the aircraft from being grounded in ZZZ; away from ZZZ2 where repairs could be more readily carried out. Honestly this was partly because of knowing that the company would probably not like for me to have written it up then (I did inform the Chief Pilot of the situation upon return to ZZZ; however).

The autopilot along with copilot side MCP autopilot switch/lights were verified operational. In light of recent changes to health screenings for COVID-19 in ZZZZ1 the flight crew came to a unanimous decision that since the malfunction had rectified itself and posed no further issues the malfunction would not be written up as a discrepancy at that time unless the problem persisted. This decision/action was likely a direct result of at least 1 crewmember's concerns about safety/security and the uncertainty of officials actions in ZZZZ1 during this COVID-19 pandemic.The actions by the flight crew are a direct result of unprecedented times amidst the COVID-19 pandemic forcing crews to analyze safety in a new way and juggling decisions in an attempt to find a positive outcome.Further actions could/should have been taken by the crew to at a minimum at least consult the DDG (Dispatch Deviations Guide) with regard to the lighting.

Just prior to fire bottle arming step; all alerts and warning cease on their own.  We discussed and considered the likelihood that both compartments had independently caught fire and extinguished on their own simultaneously and agreed that it was very likely a malfunction.  We elected not to arm or discharge the fire bottle(s) as the situation no longer conformed to the QRH condition statements and our reasoning that there was a malfunction.  We did; however; elect to continue to ZZZ.  Upon landing on Runway XX; we immediately shut down the right engine while establishing communication with crash/fire rescue and asked them to conduct thermal imaging assessment of the forward and aft lower cargo compartments.  Both were reported as cold.  We taxied to the ramp.Upon arrival a ZZZ; ramp personnel opened the lower cargo compartments.  Ramp and maintenance both reported that they had been loaded in excess of the compartment's marked limits.  From the MX write-up resolution 'Upon arrival at ZZZ; it was noted that the FWD and AFT cargo compartments were loaded with bulk freight all the way to the ceilings'.  All system tests were normal and our best guess is that improper compartment loading led to the erroneous fire indications.  No obvious equipment deficiencies were found.Suggestions: Retraining and refreshing of ramp personnel regarding the importance of proper loading procedures and compliance with limitations.  It may be instructive to inform them of the consequences of failure to comply with procedures.  Also of note/concern was the fact that ZZZ ATC did not have any contact information for [company] operations.  Because of the time critical nature of the incident; we were not able to communicate directly with the company [Ramp or Operations]; and ATC did not have the information to do so.  I suspect that is an item that needs refreshing at more than just this one station.\nWhile cruising at FL360 enroute in light turbulence we had a FWD/AFT Cargo Fire indication. As the pilot monitoring I pulled out the emergency checklist and the pilot flying recommended diverting into ZZZ. We [advised] ATC and started an emergency descent. After 1 minute or more the indication extinguished. We continued our descent into ZZZ and full stopped on RWY XX and had fire rescue run the thermal gun over our lower cargo compartment where the indication originated. The cargo compartment was cold; so we taxied to the ramp and shutdown and gave the jet to maintenance.Cause: Upon arrival mx opened the cargo door where the lower compartment was loaded to the ceiling. Our best guess is the improper loading was causal to the erroneous cargo fire indication. Suggestions: Ensure the ramp cargo loading team follows all directions when loading cargo. If there is a limit to height of stacking parcels to allow airflow; it is essential to follow the limitations.

The lack of communication between sectors; between TMU and ZZZ with a rapidly changing game plan was hard to follow. Luckily there wasn't a loss. I am working mids because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I haven't done a mid with ZZZ arrivals; and holding and weather reroutes in several years. Because of social distancing I didn't want to call for a D-side; and felt that once they told me the first time they were accepting arrivals I was good to go; but once they changed the plan; I needed some help quickly. Thankfully Area 3 was holding an aircraft; and separated several conflictions for me.No recommendations. Its an unusual time; with unusual flow; unusual crews working traffic they are not used to.

It was briefed that Operation managers would stay out of the areas from controllers as much as possible and controllers would not cover the CIC desk in order to limit the possibility of spreading the virus. Yesterday and today our OM has been roaming around the Control Room as if there is no direction to remain clear of the workforce. OM is also requiring the FLM to open sectors based on staffing not traffic needs. Both of these things I do not believe are good practice in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

	["I am submitting this safety report to highlight a growing challenging environment with COVID-19 and related training and currency issues.  On the flight I flew to ZZZ yesterday; I was paired with a new FO who is on an extension trying to consolidate and hasn't been flying as a reserve.  He reportedly has been trying to get flying and has been unable.  I also have not been flying much with reserve and 'bunky' trips.  My last 'assignment' was a landing class in ZZZ1.  For our trip yesterday; we were scheduled to fly ZZZ2-ZZZ-ZZZ2.  Being new and having less than 100 hours; the FO couldn't takeoff or land in ZZZ2; so I decided that I'd fly to cruise; let the FO fly enroute and descent to ZZZ; and then reverse that returning so he could gather some experience.  With ZZZ being a new airport for both of us; and with non-precision approaches in use; that wasn't my first choice (I had intended to fly into ZZZ); but I didn't want to take both legs and not give the FO an opportunity to fly.  With the inexperience of the FO and both of our currency issues; my brief then included the request that we definitely watch one another and work together as a team.  Our flight worked that way on departure and enroute; but then became somewhat challenging for both of us going into ZZZ.  The weather was overcast in light rain and the RNAV approach to [Runway] XX was in use.  Prior to descent; the FO conducted a thorough brief and reviewed/briefed the RNAV approach procedures from the Approach Briefing Guide.  All then went well until we were vectored toward the final course just outside ZZZZZ fix; told to maintain 5;000 until established; and cleared for the approach.  We were then very careful setting up everything for the rarely conducted RNAV approach per SOP.  The problem however was that our vector by ATC was poor and we didn't intercept until just slightly outside ZZZZZ which is normally crossed at 4;300 feet.  With a combination of being focused on the RNAV procedures; ATC communications (Controller realized at the last minute that his vector had been poor); and honestly some rustiness on my part; I didn't immediately recognize that we were high until we broke through the clouds just outside ZZZZZ and I saw the runway.  The FO then immediately disconnected the autopilot in visual conditions; added additional drag and was able to salvage the approach to a safe landing.  It worked out; but the approach and descent was obviously not as well conducted as either of us would have preferred.\nI was the Pilot Flying on an RNAV Approach to ZZZ Runway XX in IMC. While the approach and landing were successful; I am filing a report because of the general feeling of rustiness and feeling more behind the jet than I was comfortable with. I am a reserve on this specific aircraft type fleet and have not flown much due to both my seniority/reserve status and the COVID-19 situation's impact on our operations.For background; I...was able to pick up one trip in late last year; and then was on leave; which was not ideal; but unavoidable. Upon my return I was back to being a reserve when the COVID-19 pandemic began to reduce our flying.Scheduling put me on another flight in order to extend my consolidation window by XX days. I had no warm up and had not flown since late last year. Although successful; I was not at the comfort level I would have liked in order to complete the flight.", {"entities": [[1290, 1297, "WEATHER"], [1302, 1310, "WEATHER"], [1320, 1324, "WEATHER"], [155, 159, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [202, 204, "ABBREVIATION"], [266, 272, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [325, 331, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [375, 381, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [516, 519, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [582, 584, "ABBREVIATION"], [594, 601, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [605, 609, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [641, 644, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [648, 654, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [664, 666, "ABBREVIATION"], [667, 670, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [683, 690, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [836, 846, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [902, 905, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [970, 972, "ABBREVIATION"], [991, 994, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1026, 1028, "ABBREVIATION"], [1333, 1337, "ABBREVIATION"], [1338, 1346, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1384, 1391, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1397, 1399, "ABBREVIATION"], [1452, 1456, "ABBREVIATION"], [1457, 1465, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1486, 1494, "CREW"], [1664, 1672, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1748, 1752, "ABBREVIATION"], [1753, 1761, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1815, 1818, "CREW"], [1915, 1925, "ALTITUDE"], [1971, 1975, "ABBREVIATION"], [1988, 1991, "CREW"], [2008, 2018, "CREW"], [2235, 2241, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2248, 2250, "ABBREVIATION"], [2285, 2294, "AIRPLANE"], [2367, 2375, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2419, 2427, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2432, 2439, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2530, 2536, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2543, 2547, "ABBREVIATION"], [2548, 2556, "CREW"], [2592, 2600, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2821, 2826, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3226, 3232, "AIRPLANE"], [3274, 3279, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["We were operating a morning first flight of day. The aircraft was put on a hardstand with no tug where with guidance from the ramp crew we would be able to start both engines and be directed to the movement area of the ramp. After completing the Engine Start Check; I looked over to the Ramper and with their permission; I released the parking brake. I however; did not reengage the parking brake. I then directed the First Officer to start both engines. The number 2 engine was started first. Following the start of the number 1 engine; the First Officer stepped on the brakes and simultaneously engaged the parking brake. This caused the airplane to stop abruptly. I asked the First Officer why he did what he did; and he said that we were moving. I then said that it was my mistake for not having the parking brake engaged; but we were moving slowly and we were far from any equipment and people. I then asked the First Officer two questions Why did he not say to me that the aircraft was moving and I would have applied the brakes and why did he apply both the brakes and the parking brake at the same time ? He said that he was not sure the brakes alone would have stopped the airplane. We then proceeded with the rest of the normal checklists and taxied to the runway and departed. In flight; the Flight Attendant said she was injured from the whiplash and was bruised. She said she may see a doctor upon reaching our destination. At the end of the flight I exchanged my contact information with the Flight Attendant to keep me informed of her physical condition. The whole sequence of events started with me not engaging the parking brake after releasing it for the out time. The threat of not recognizing that we do not have rampers to tell us to reset the brake after push was not addressed during our threat discussion and mitigation. My error was not seeing the airplane moving after the number one engine started and stopping the airplane before the First Officer. The undesired state was the fact that the aircraft moved when it should not have causing potential harm to the ramp crew and outside equipment. The other error I would say was CRM. The First Officer acted in the interest of safety and was the first to recognize the movement of the aircraft. He however over reacted. Based on the fact the airplane was moving slowly and we were far from rampers and equipment; I think he should have told me that we were moving and I would have stopped the airplane. If I did not react he then should have stepped on the brakes. This was the error on CRM our part. After talking to him I found out that he just finished IOE recently and this was his first trip after completing IOE. I think lack of experience in actual line operations caused him to act the way he did. I also should have checked with the Flight Attendant to see how she was doing after the airplane came to a stop. What I learned was to be extra vigilant when you are taxiing out with no towbar from the gate. If we were close to people or equipment; this could have been bad. Addressing ramp operations with no tug driver telling you to 'set the brake' is a threat that we should have discussed and talked about. I also need to be more aware of aircraft (unintentional) movement in all situations and react appropriately.", {"entities": [[126, 130, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [219, 223, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [418, 431, "CREW"], [468, 474, "AIRPLANE"], [530, 536, "AIRPLANE"], [542, 555, "CREW"], [679, 692, "CREW"], [917, 930, "CREW"], [1253, 1259, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1267, 1273, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1278, 1286, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1910, 1916, "AIRPLANE"], [1962, 1975, "CREW"], [2088, 2092, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2162, 2175, "CREW"], [2946, 2953, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2982, 2986, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3066, 3070, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

	["Flight plan was 'MRSHH1.DDRTH.TELCU Pretty early; we got cleared direct SAA. We got the weather at the field and decided to do the RNAV 05. We got cleared direct ZUBUB(IF) and shortly after that we got cleared to descend and maintain 13000 ft. until established for the approach then cleared for the approach. I was the Pilot Flying; upon reaching 13000 ft. I decided to set the next altitude 10100 ft. (after receiving the clearance for the approach). For some unknown reason I began to descend to the set altitude 10100 ft. Around 11700 feet we received a 'Caution terrain' I disconnected the autopilot and began to climb to 13000 ft. As soon as we received the warning I understood immediately my mistake. We climbed back to 13000 ft. and completed the approach and landing without any further issues.I have no idea why I decided to descend lower than 13000 feet even though its very clear on the approach plate and from the clearance. Was it because I had woken [early morning; two hours prior to] show time; that perhaps might have been a contributing factor since neither of us reacted when we saw the terrain color change. What ever the reason was have no excuse; this will never happen again. After landing my partner talked about it; it really bothered me because this event could have been so much worse and the fact that I made such a beginner's mistake. I am so thankful we had the alert system on the airplane.\nWe were assigned the RNAV 5 for SAA. ATC cleared us direct to ZUBUB and we were told to maintain 13000 feet until established. We were heading approximately northwest. As we neared the smart turn towards YIDUR the Captain selected 10100 ft. for the next altitude and commenced the descent at around 2000 fpm. I was asked to activate vectors to final. This removed the smart turn and put us in heading mode. We had the MFD set to relative terrain. This mode started to display green terrain on our flight path. Which was unexpected for this portion of the approach.

The Bonanza was close enough I could see the pilot and clear aircraft detail. Immediately the student and I pitched and banked away from the aircraft to maneuver away. Right afterward; ATC asked us if that aircraft was at our same altitude. I then stated that he was and reported a 'near miss'. The rest of the flight resumed and we completed an approach at ZZZ.

I promptly called after landing and gave them my oral narrative of what happened.I think that perhaps ATC is being overworked. Throughout the flight we did receive many traffic advisories.

	["Arrived at the aircraft and completed preflight items for a maintenance ferry flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 for the purpose of parking Aircraft X in ZZZ1 for stowage due to COVID-19 economic downturn. During pre-flight I determined that there was not a current maintenance release form in the aircraft Logbook. I called maintenance on the radio and requested a new maintenance release. Maintenance said we did not need a maintenance release form because we were flying a maintenance ferry flight and we only needed a maintenance ferry document; which should be in the aircraft logbook. There was no maintenance ferry document in the aircraft logbook or in the flight plan paperwork.I called Dispatch and requested a new maintenance release and was told all I needed was the maintenance ferry document. I told Dispatch that I did not have one anywhere on the aircraft and I needed him to send me one. The Dispatcher told me that he couldn't 'cut & paste' the maintenance ferry document into ACARS; but that he could take a picture and send it to me on my phone. He sent me a picture of the maintenance ferry document and I looked it over. I had never seen a maintenance ferry document and therefore had no idea if the Dispatcher had sent me the proper documentation. Per the flight plan; we were dispatched Part 91; and having been told by both the Maintenance and Dispatch that we had what we needed; we proceeded to operate the flight safely and on-time between ZZZ and ZZZ1. It was only an hour after our arrival into ZZZ1 that we were contacted by the flight operations and were told that we had departed without the proper maintenance release form. I sent a picture of the maintenance ferry document from Dispatch and a copy of the flight plan and told her I would file a report. We were not the only flight to be dispatched improperly by Maintenance and Dispatch.Later that evening we received a report; detailing what a correct maintenance ferry document should be.

	["I was the Pilot Flying.  We were cleared for takeoff on Runway XX and the Tower reported the winds at 190 degrees 19 knots.  We weighed roughly 441;100 kilos.  As the engines stabilized I pushed TOGA and the engines accelerated to takeoff thrust and moments later we heard a bang and the airplane began to veer off to the left.  I rejected the takeoff at around 40 knots.  We notified the Tower and he replied that they heard a loud bang from inside their Tower cab as well and suspected that it was a compressor stall.  We stopped the plane on the runway to assess the engines and brake temps.  We asked the Tower if they saw any flames or smoke coming from any of the engines and they said no.  All engine indications were normal and brakes and tires were good.  There were no EICAS messages.  We cleared the runway and elected to taxi back to the gate.  They cleared us to cross the approach end of runway XX and the First Officer looked for any FOD that may have come off of the plane but he saw no signs of FOD.  The First Officer did ask the Tower to inspect the runway for FOD just in case.  I taxied in with number 1&2 engines at idle.  We arrived at the gate shortly after and Maintenance was debriefed of the possible engine compressor stall.  We were unsure of which engine it was that compressor stalled.  Maintenance mentioned to me later that the number one engine was a suspect due to an engine change in ZZZ and a history of bleed malfunctions on number 1 and 2 engines.  I told the mechanics that by the way the plane reacted and veered to the left; I would suspect the #1 engine to be the culprit as well.  They agreed that the best thing to do was to return to the gate because the engine is not supposed to do this.  I have to commend all of my crew on the professionalism that they showed and working together as a whole crew.  I suggest that the training department keeps giving scenarios to reject a takeoff for in the simulator.  This event was trained for and I couldn't have asked for a better crew.\nThis is the same airplane that we rejected the takeoff for the day prior for the same problem- compressor stall. The aircraft had an engine change (#1 engine) in ZZZ 2 legs prior to our events. After we rejected our takeoff yesterday; Maintenance borescoped number one and number 2 engines. No defects were found. Approximately 30 hours were spent working on the plane. Maintenance did a high power engine run prior to signing it off and returning it back to service. I was Pilot Monitoring this time and the First Officer performed the takeoff. Our takeoff weight was 435.7 tons. There was a Low level wind shear advisory in effect at the time of our takeoff. The flight deck performance generated a max thrust [96.7 N1) flaps 20 takeoff. The Tower winds were light and variable reported 230 @ 4 kts. We were cleared for takeoff with the winds light and variable. Once the engines were stabilized at 45% N1 and we were rolling; I pushed the TOGA switches and the thrust levers advanced the thrust up to takeoff thrust. During engine acceleration and us only doing approximately 20-30 knots; we all heard 2 loud bangs and simultaneously saw a bright flash of light on the left side of the plane. I decided to reject the takeoff again. I gained control of the aircraft and brought the plane to a stop on the runway. We advised the tower and they also heard the loud bang from up in the tower cab. The Airport Operations guy was at the passenger terminal a couple miles away and he heard the loud bang and immediately made his way over to us. There was no smoke or fire coming from any of the number 1 or 2 engines. We assessed the condition of the engines and determined all engine parameters were normal so we elected to leave number 1&2 engines running at idle power. There were no EICAS messages. All of the tires were intact with normal tire pressures indication and the brake temps were normal. As we exited the runway and taxied back to the gate; the ops vehicle did a runway inspection for FOD and did not find anything.

	["I was given taxi clearance At ZZZ. My clearance was for XX via A; B1. As I taxied from the ; a grey and blue Cirrus taxied from general parking taking A in front of me; not too close as to cause issue. As we neared B1 the Cirrus slowed considerably resulting in my needing to apply brakes to slow. As I applied brakes; the right functioned normally whilst the left was unresponsive or had little to no effect on performance. As such the aircraft veered right. As I was also needing to still slow down I cut the throttles to their rear stops hard. This caused the right engine to quit resulting in the aircraft veering even more to the right. I was applying full left rudder as well with little affect. The aircraft veered far to the right of the taxiway; resulting in the right main and the nose gear to leave the pavement. The aircraft came to a stop with the nose gear and right main in the sod. The right main sunk down considerably causing a delay in returning the aircraft to the pavement. A mechanic was called out and assisted in recovery of the aircraft. He visually inspected the aircraft and deemed it airworthy with no damage sustained. In thinking back to the chain of events leading up to it; I think I could have better anticipated the aircraft ahead of me slowing. If they were given the same clearance I was they would have been slowing for the turn on to B1. However; they continued to the run up area at A1; so they may have been confused on their clearance and that is why they slowed when they did as well. I have experienced similar issues with the left main on this aircraft in the last few months and have worked with our maintenance department to resolve the issue. On 3 different occasions during run-up the left main would quit functioning and the aircraft would begin to turn to the right and on one occasion while slowing to make a left turn to park the left brake quit functioning and I had to pull the mixtures to kill the engines to stop since the only brake I had was the right which was causing the airplane to turn to the right heading off the pavement. The brake has been serviced and a seal replaced which seemed to fix the issue for the last month or so. Had I pulled the mixtures instead of the throttles I might have been able to keep the aircraft on the pavement or had I not cut the throttles so forcefully. However; when the aircraft started doing something opposite my commands I pulled them back harder than I should have. I will be mindful of taxi speed in the future while we work to resolve the issue.

	["While en route to ZZZ we received a NOTAM indicating the runway edge lights were INOP for XX/XY.  I discussed my plan with the First Officer to shoot the approach to Runway XX and see how it looks; thinking there were still runway end identifier lights.  I briefed the approach emphasizing terrain being the biggest threat.  If it didn't look safe we'd execute a go-around and divert to our alternate (ZZZ1).  On arrival; ZZZ TRACON informed us a prior aircraft had reported the lights out and if we went missed to fly the published missed and ZZZ1 would be the alternate.  During the approach; we were notified by someone on CTAF that all the runway lights were out including the runway end identifier lights.  We broke out of the bases prior to the 1;000 feet call and continued to the 500 feet call when I called for a go-around.  The go-around started out well following SOP's.  I requested the A/P on right away and we contacted ZZZ TRACON while climbing.  This is when things started going haywire.  ZZZ TRACON gave us a climb to 4;300 feet and a right turn to VOR.  The airplane was rapidly approaching 4;300 feet and I focused my attention on altitude; selected V/S to slow the descent.  We ended up passing 4;300 feet by about 300 feet and I V/S back down to 4;300 feet.  The First Officer reported that we had passed 4;300 feet and ZZZ TRACON responded climb to 6;000 feet.  I didn't hear the climb to 6000 feet instructions.  After a short time I notice we weren't turning to VOR and engaged HDG SEL and entered a right turn towards VOR.  A few seconds after initiating the turn; ZZZ TRACON called a terrain warning climb 6;000 feet turn right direct PDZ; we were already in the turn and I FLCH'ed a climb to 6;000 feet.  Once we were headed towards PDZ and at 6;000 feet there was a little confusion to which runway ZZZ1 was using.  ATIS was calling for 26's but ZZZ TRACON said they were landing the 8's.  We were able to load the approach and land without further incident.   The First Officer and I talked about the event later and neither of us remembers seeing any EPGWS warnings or cautions from the aircraft.  I was pretty task saturated for a short time; so there could have been.  We also discussed why the aircraft wasn't tracking correctly with LNAV engaged and couldn't figure it out.  Had we not sequenced the box correctly?   I talked with Dispatch after landing and he saw that we received the NOTAM for the HIRL but not the REIL's being U/S.  He told us that we were scheduled to give it another try in 45 minutes; but I called at that point.  I felt; fatigue; contributed to this event and filled a fatigue reported for this event.   I would have done a few things differently.  1.  Not even attempt the approach; coordinate with dispatch much sooner about diverting to our alternate.  2. Keep a better scan.  I was overly focused at maintaining altitude and not aircraft track.\nOn a scheduled night flight [to] ZZZ; we received a NOTAM via ACARS that the ZZZ runway edge lights were unserviceable.  We discussed the consequences of the NOTAM and determined that some runway lighting; such as the runway end identifier lights; should still be operative.  We agreed to attempt an approach and execute a missed approach if necessary; and we reviewed the missed approach procedure; which included a climb to 2;000 feet followed by a right turn to avoid terrain and a final altitude of 6;000 feet.  The missed approach procedure was correctly programmed in the FMS following the ILS XX.  We checked in with ZZZ approach; who informed us that a prior aircraft had reported the runway lights inoperative; if we needed to fly the missed approach we should fly it as published; and confirmed with us that ZZZ1 would be the alternate.  There was no Tower operating at ZZZ; so on a 10 mile final on the ILS XX; I made a CTAF call and attempted to activate the pilot controlled lighting.  ZZZ Security responded and said the runway lights were indeed inoperative.  As we continued the approach; we were able to pick up the PAPI's; but we discussed the fact that we could not see any other lights; including the runway end identifier lights that we had expected.  With the dark; rainy conditions; we determined a landing would be unsafe and at 500 feet AGL; the Captain called go-around and executed the go-around procedures for the published missed approach.  At approximately 2;000 feet; the Captain called for LNAV; which I selected and noticed at the time that we still had not reached the departure end of the runway; so even though the procedure was a right hand turn at 2;000 feet; I assumed the Flight Director was not commanding that turn yet since we had not reached the end of the runway.  I made another CTAF call and went back to ZZZ control and informed him that we were flying the missed approach.  He acknowledged and told us to level off at 4;300 feet.  When he told us that; we were passing 4;000 feet in the climb.  I reset the altitude window from 6;000 feet to 4;300 feet; the Captain started to level off; leveled at 4;600 feet; and started a descent back to 4;300 feet.  I told ZZZ we were already above 4;300 feet and asked if we needed to descend or if we could continue the climb; and he said terrain alert; continue to 6;000 feet; turn right direct to the PDZ VOR.  I reset 6;000 feet in the altitude window while the Captain started a right turn toward PDZ and a climb to 6;000 feet.  I then put direct PDZ in the FMS and the Captain selected LNAV.  ZZZ then informed us that ZZZ1 was landing Runway XAL and he would give us vectors for the ILS.  We pulled up ATIS; which said they were landing [Runway] 26R.  I brought up the discrepancy to ZZZ; who confirmed it was [Runway] XZR; and we landed uneventfully in ZZZ1. After we blocked in; the Captain called Scheduling; who asked us to wait until daylight and fly back to ZZZ.  However; the Captain and I discussed our level of fatigue following a circadian flip and the divert; and we chose to call fatigued.  We decided our chances of making mistakes was elevated and did not feel fit to continue flying without rest.  In our debrief; the Captain and I discussed what we think caused the event and what we could have done to prevent or resolve it.  Fatigue was certainly a factor.  We should have called Dispatch to discuss the REDL U/S NOTAM when we received it; which may have prevented us from attempting the approach at all.  I am fairly certain the FMS was sequenced correctly to cycle to the missed approach; but I have no other explanation for why it did not give us the right turn at 2;000 feet.  The Captain and I should have communicated more clearly with each other to make sure we heard the same instructions from the controller and were following the correct procedures; despite the Flight Director's failure to provide the guidance we expected.  Due to our task saturation; the Captain and I didn't both hear or process the same information at the right time; so we were slow to recognize that we weren't receiving the right guidance; and I did not confirm with him that he had heard the controller's instructions; so we were slower than we should have been to start the turn and resume the climb to 6;000 feet; generating the terrain advisory from ZZZ.  And I should have voiced my concern to him at 2;000 feet when the turn didn't start; but I assumed we just hadn't gotten far enough along in the missed approach yet for the flight director to command the turn; i.e. the end of the runway; so I continued with other tasks.  I should have prioritized and focused more on flying the missed approach correctly; particularly with the threat of terrain; and put off radio calls and less important tasks for later.", {"entities": [[6873, 6883, "WEATHER"], [36, 41, "ABBREVIATION"], [57, 63, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [127, 140, "CREW"], [154, 162, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [224, 230, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [269, 277, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [426, 432, "ABBREVIATION"], [515, 518, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [585, 593, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [644, 650, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [681, 687, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [751, 761, "ALTITUDE"], [788, 796, "ALTITUDE"], [838, 847, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [938, 944, "ABBREVIATION"], [951, 959, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1010, 1016, "ABBREVIATION"], [1027, 1032, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1036, 1046, "ALTITUDE"], [1067, 1070, "ABBREVIATION"], [1098, 1109, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1110, 1120, "ALTITUDE"], [1186, 1193, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1216, 1226, "ALTITUDE"], [1236, 1244, "ALTITUDE"], [1268, 1278, "ALTITUDE"], [1285, 1298, "CREW"], [1327, 1337, "ALTITUDE"], [1346, 1352, "ABBREVIATION"], [1363, 1368, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1372, 1382, "ALTITUDE"], [1403, 1408, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1412, 1421, "ALTITUDE"], [1487, 1490, "ABBREVIATION"], [1503, 1506, "ABBREVIATION"], [1544, 1547, "ABBREVIATION"], [1595, 1601, "ABBREVIATION"], [1627, 1632, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1633, 1643, "ALTITUDE"], [1711, 1716, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1720, 1730, "ALTITUDE"], [1772, 1782, "ALTITUDE"], [1821, 1827, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1845, 1849, "ABBREVIATION"], [1879, 1885, "ABBREVIATION"], [1901, 1908, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1944, 1952, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1957, 1961, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1994, 2007, "CREW"], [2366, 2374, "CREW"], [2381, 2388, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2421, 2426, "ABBREVIATION"], [2733, 2741, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2960, 2965, "ABBREVIATION"], [2970, 2975, "AIRPLANE"], [2989, 2995, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3066, 3071, "ABBREVIATION"], [3097, 3103, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3126, 3132, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3208, 3216, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3231, 3246, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3281, 3296, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3325, 3330, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3334, 3344, "ALTITUDE"], [3411, 3421, "ALTITUDE"], [3428, 3443, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3486, 3489, "ABBREVIATION"], [3504, 3507, "ABBREVIATION"], [3536, 3544, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3601, 3607, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3644, 3647, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3652, 3667, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3678, 3681, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3769, 3774, "CREW"], [3822, 3825, "ABBREVIATION"], [3879, 3884, "CREW"], [3943, 3949, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4003, 4011, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4129, 4135, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4261, 4269, "ALTITUDE"], [4270, 4273, "ABBREVIATION"], [4279, 4286, "CREW"], [4321, 4330, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4360, 4375, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4395, 4405, "ALTITUDE"], [4411, 4418, "CREW"], [4532, 4538, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4594, 4604, "ALTITUDE"], [4709, 4715, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4802, 4808, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4813, 4828, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4875, 4885, "ALTITUDE"], [4926, 4936, "ALTITUDE"], [4944, 4949, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4973, 4979, "AIRPLANE"], [4985, 4995, "ALTITUDE"], [4999, 5009, "ALTITUDE"], [5015, 5022, "CREW"], [5056, 5066, "ALTITUDE"], [5082, 5089, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5098, 5108, "ALTITUDE"], [5144, 5154, "ALTITUDE"], [5181, 5188, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5217, 5222, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5263, 5273, "ALTITUDE"], [5304, 5307, "ABBREVIATION"], [5318, 5328, "ALTITUDE"], [5345, 5351, "AIRPLANE"], [5362, 5369, "CREW"], [5408, 5413, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5417, 5427, "ALTITUDE"], [5459, 5462, "ABBREVIATION"], [5471, 5478, "CREW"], [5530, 5537, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5586, 5589, "ABBREVIATION"], [5605, 5609, "ABBREVIATION"], [5632, 5639, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5734, 5740, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5788, 5795, "CREW"], [5855, 5858, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5886, 5893, "CREW"], [6094, 6100, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6136, 6143, "CREW"], [6301, 6309, "CREW"], [6334, 6339, "ABBREVIATION"], [6409, 6417, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6451, 6454, "ABBREVIATION"], [6495, 6510, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6589, 6599, "ALTITUDE"], [6606, 6613, "CREW"], [6889, 6896, "CREW"], [7202, 7207, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7211, 7221, "ALTITUDE"], [7312, 7322, "ALTITUDE"], [7411, 7426, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7496, 7502, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [7584, 7590, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7595, 7610, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7675, 7680, "AIRPLANE"]]}],

	["We had a situation for Aircraft X due to and ENG 2 no dispatch message due to Ignition Channel B fault. When troubleshooting Maintenance found the connector/switch to the EHCL (Electro-Hydraulic cowl lock) broken. The MEL was applied for the ENG 2 Thrust Reversers. At this time there were no Maintenance personnel available to due an ENGINE run after they swapped E2 igniter plugs from channel A to B and B to A IAW the MEL. The Mechanics turned over the aircraft to the next shift to complete the Engine Runs. I arrived and retrieved the logbook and went with another mechanic to complete the Engine Runs. We performed the engine runs and called aircraft back into service approximately 30 mins prior to first departure of the day. We then recieved a call from [Maintenance Control] approximately 10 minutes prior to departure saying the pilot is reporting ENG 2 Rev INHIBIT message not being displayed on EICAS IAW MEL. Instead ENG 2 REV PROT FAULT displayed. The MEL that was signed off as previously c/w referenced AMM so we started there and found that it referenced AMM deactivation of the ICU(Isolation Control Unit). While following the AMM for Deactivating the ICU I saw that it said open Circuit Breaker and install a CB ring on E2 REVERSER CB as well as making sure the ICU inhibition lever was in the inhibit position with the quick release pin installed to make sure the lever is making contact with the micro switches. The lever was in the inhibit position but the quick release pin was not in the correct position. I moved the pin to the correct position and followed the last step of the deactivation process which was to make sure the E2 REV INHIBIT MESSAGE is shown on EICAS which it was. At this point I did not see in the ICU deactivation procedures of closing the CB and removing the ring as it was not in that part of the AMM. Instead of going back and referencing the AMM section the MEL had me go to and discussing with the other mechanic of whether or not we should close the CB we determined that it was not in the DEACTIVATION procedures so we should leave it open since the discrepancy was corrected. I should of referenced back the original AMM to make sure I followed the JOB CLOSE UP section as this would of told me to remove the CB ring and close it upon completion of deactivating the TR. Since the MEL was done by the prior shift I did not think to go back to that reference as I only performed the ICU deactivation even though I know that all AMM sections have a JOB CLOSE UP section. I also think the several Human Factors played a role in my error. The STRESS and PRESSURE of the plane being delayed after being [on ground] for a long period of time DISTRACTED me from being focused on reviewing my work and the AMM. I also had a LACK OF AWARENESS to realize the ICU deactivation did not have a JOB CLOSE UP SECTION. I think it would be helpful to add this section to the ICU deactivation part of the AMM to state if no other Maintenance is being performed to complete this section.", {"entities": [[125, 136, "CREW"], [293, 304, "CREW"], [514, 521, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [625, 631, "AIRPLANE"], [764, 775, "CREW"], [840, 845, "CREW"], [908, 913, "AIRPLANE"], [1688, 1693, "AIRPLANE"], [2965, 2976, "CREW"]]}],

	["Today I had the shift logs for 5 scheduled ferry flights; Aicraft X; Aircraft Y; Aircraft Z; Aircraft A; and Aircraft B. Started off by verifying departure times and flight numbers. Then reviewed the open items; MEL's; and scheduled Maintenance both assigned and possible expiring. Followed up with planning to confirm that there were no overtime items that I may have missed. Contacted the stations the aircraft were located; ZZZ; ZZZ1; and ZZZ2 and made sure they were aware of the scheduled ferry flights and reviewed the open items with them. Updated all 5 aircraft ferry flight checklist. Aircraft Z at ZZZ2 was the first scheduled out to ZZZ3. On taxi out the crew had the leading edge device amber light on the fwd panel. The aircraft returned to the gate where Maintenance evaluated the light and was unable to reset it. So; we placed it on deferral IAW the MEL. Sent the new arrange meter to request the new MFD (Maintenance Ferry Document) the equivalent of an MRD (Maintenance Release Document). The aircraft taxis back out and they receive a takeoff warning for misconfiguration of the aircraft for takeoff. Back to the gate again. this time we had to have Maintenance work the item as it is not deferrable. They replaced a box and performed the test and returned the aircraft to ferry flight ready status. 3rd time is a charm. the aircraft left ZZZ2 for ZZZ3.In the middle of all of this we had issues with Aircraft B in ZZZ1 with the potable water and a dead MEL along with 2 DIPs that required reinspect. During my conversation with ZZZ1 initially we needed the dead MEL cleared. It had been repaired but needed leak checked. Upon servicing the potable water and leak checking it they found that it still leaked. We were asked to have them fix it prior to departure. After further evaluation it would be a major job. The decision was made to go ahead and let it fly with the dead MEL added to the MFD. keep in mind this is several phone calls and all going on at the same time as Aircraft Z and regular calls for deferrals and any other number of problems and questions. After clearing all that up I went through my other aircraft to see how close to departure they were. that is when I noticed that [Aircraft] X and Aircraft A were airborne. Thought good; hey made it out without any problems. So; I went to update the paper work and download the MFD's and attach them to the logs and send them to the shift managers. that is when I panicked. When I pulled up [Aircraft] X and saw it still showed just an arrange meter I went to verify that it was truly in flight. My fears were confirmed it was. So; I called (Shift Manager) and told him. HE was on a call and told me he would get right back with me. While waiting on his call back I started reviewing the other aircraft and found that the same thing happened with Aircraft A. I sent [Shift Manager] a [message] letting him know about the 2nd aircraft. Shift Manager asked what happened and asked that I contact ZZZ1 to see what I could find out. I contacted ZZZ1 [Maintenance]. He explained that the crews called and they told them that they would have to contact [Maintenance Control] for the MFD as they are unable to issue one.After that call I followed up on Aircraft A as it was due out soon and reviewed the logs and logbook and issued the MFD.During follow up review of what all happened I discovered that the 2 DIPs requested to be worked had not been cleared. So; I notified Shift Manager and [ZZZ1 Maintenance] about the flight with overdue items not addressed on the MFD or cleared prior to flight.A couple possibilities. 1. One would to add to the procedure that prior to any ferry flight the crew should contact [Maintenance Control]  and review the aircraft maintenance status; flight ready status and any special request.2. Would be to setup the ferry flights like the regular flights where if the crew tries to depart without a  valid MFD they receive a warning to the flight deck stating they need a MFD. (I believe this one is possibly in work.)3. Have the auto generated log page for inspection be generated locked so Maintenance has to contact [Maintenance Control] when the ferry flight inspection is complete. With this option I think we should include in the inspection item discrepancy a statement like ***THIS ITEM MUST BE CLEARED PRIOR TO ANY FLIGHT CONTACT [Maintenance Control]***.

	["We were involved in a near mid-air collision during an instructional flight in my C177RG.We had departed westbound under excellent VMC.  After crossing the river; we flew south along the river.  After about 3 miles we commenced a left turn to the northeast in order to reenter left downwind.  We were at the pattern altitude.  As we were about to roll out of the turn my student and I both noticed out of our left window a red and white high wing airplane slide directly beneath us.  It's nose was pointed to the west/southwest but it appeared to have been traveling south to north.  I estimated the closest point of contact was 50 feet.  We had been monitoring and announcing our position on the CTAF.  Almost immediately someone came on the CTAF frequency and asked 'Cessna 177 do you hear?'.  It turned out to be the other aircraft.  The person on the radio was extremely irate and claimed we had 'cut him off'.  He said he had been flying along the river and chastised us for crossing the river.  When I could get a word in I said we hadn't seen him and I wasn't aware of any rule that precludes flying across a river.  He then went on a rant about faster/slower aircraft.  Considering that we hadn't even seen the other aircraft until after the incident; what he was saying didn't make any sense.  I mentioned again that we hadn't seen him; would keep our eyes 'peeled' (at his direction); and suggested he do the same.  At this point he got extremely abusive.  As we continued on with our approach; a third aircraft who had apparently been monitoring the conversation jumped in and the two of them had an argument about whether the incident aircraft was justified in his claims.  The third (uninvolved) aircraft was supporting us and the last we heard of the conversation was the third aircraft telling the incident pilot something to the effect of 'If you don't like it; you shouldn't be flying'.  My student and I spent a lot of time analyzing the incident later; and we couldn't figure out why we did not see the incident aircraft.  One of our objectives on that flight was local area familiarization and we were already looking outside for traffic and visual landmarks.  According to the other pilot's stated activity the incident aircraft should have been clearly visible.  We also don't know how/why the pilot was on the CTAF.  One possibility is that it was a Citabria that had been in the pattern previously.  However; based on the Citabria's previous announcements it was unlikely to be him given the location and the incident aircraft's apparent direction of flight.  Moreover since the incident aircraft was also a red and white high wing; during the brief glimpse I had; I specifically tried to identify it as such and concluded it wasn't a Citabria.  In my opinion in a situation like this; generally everybody wins or everybody loses.  That day we were all winners.  See-and-avoid in VMC is a shared responsibility.  We were all very fortunate the incident did not result in a collision and we could argue about it later.  Even though we were extremely vigilant; we didn't see the incident aircraft until afterward.  I would have liked to have known more about it's track; etc. with a view to learning how and why this happened and avoiding a similar situation in the future.  However the other pilot's abusiveness and self-righteousness precluded any such constructive discussion.  In the future I will spend even more time visually scanning for traffic and continue impressing it's criticality upon my students.  In addition I will avail myself of ADS-B IN capability (either portable or installed) in order to receive electronic alerts of conflicting traffic.", {"entities": [[96, 104, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [166, 170, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [282, 290, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [308, 315, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [414, 420, "AIRPLANE"], [442, 446, "AIRPLANE"], [489, 493, "AIRPLANE"], [629, 636, "ALTITUDE"], [855, 860, "AIRPLANE"], [936, 942, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1100, 1106, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1495, 1503, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1822, 1827, "CREW"], [1895, 1901, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2204, 2209, "CREW"], [2316, 2321, "CREW"], [2403, 2410, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2651, 2655, "AIRPLANE"], [3315, 3320, "CREW"]]}],
	["The CTAF frequency was quiet; and I announced that I was taking runway 24 for takeoff. Just before entering the runway; I looked; but did not see any aircraft approaching for either runway.

It was only then that I noticed the aircraft.Fortunately; that aircraft was on the ground and stopping; and I was ready to rotate; which I did; missing the other aircraft on the ground. In speaking to the airport manager later; he informed me that he had spoken to the other pilot; who had said that I wasn't on the frequency. After the airport manager informed him that I was on the frequency; and that it was he that wasn't on the frequency; they checked his radio and discovered that he was indeed on a different frequency by mistake.The lesson learned for me is just to reinforce that seeing approaching aircraft can be quite difficult; especially when they are on final with a cluttered background. Therefore; especially at uncontrolled airports; it is vital to use extra caution to ensure there are no aircraft approaching before entering the runway; and then to focus more than normal attention to such on the takeoff roll as well.", {"entities": [[64, 70, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [78, 85, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [112, 118, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [159, 170, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [182, 188, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [201, 208, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [260, 267, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [284, 290, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [607, 612, "CREW"], [793, 798, "AIRPLANE"], [928, 939, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1149, 1160, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1181, 1187, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1249, 1256, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

We adjusted the packs cooler and the smell dissipated. We had [Runway] XXL in the FMS and received a change to [Runway] XXC.

	["Our aircraft and aircrew were in good operating order. Ceilings and visibility departing ZZZ were unrestricted and we were about to finish the final leg of our 4 day trip. The First Officer was the pilot flying and the Captain was the pilot monitoring for this leg.Just prior to passing through 10;000 ft. on our climb-out the Captain checked the pressure indication control panel which indicated the cabin was pressurizing at a rate of about 500 fpm; which isn't unusual for a departure from a near sea level airport; combined with the high climb rate of our light aircraft. What did seem odd was the readings on the other two instruments; the differential gauge was pegged at zero; as was the cabin altitude gauge. These two instruments clearly were not in agreement with each other; or with the pressurization rate gauge. In talking with the First Officer as we climbed through 10;000 ft.; we thought that another way to confirm if we were pressurizing was if the Cabin Press master warning was triggered through 9;800 ft. Also we confirmed that the bleeds and packs were on with normal flow control setting. We did discuss that we were both experiencing popping ears and the First Officer thought he might have heard a creaking noise from the airframe. As we received no master warning; we thought we were probably pressurizing as the rate indicator showed; but possibly had faulty cabin differential and cabin alt gauges. At this point this Captain informed the First Officer that he was going to call Maintenance to help troubleshoot the gauges and to get a second opinion as to if we were in fact pressurizing as the crew had thought. The Captain handed the radios over to the First Officer.Maintenance control informed this Captain that there was not anything they could guide the flight crew in with respect to troubleshooting the pressure indication control panel; and that they could evaluate the system on the ground in ZZZ1 but there was not anything that could be reset or diagnosed in flight from their standpoint. At this time we were climbing through about 15;000 ft. and the panel was reading the same as it had previously; there was a slight cabin pressurization rate with no Cabin Press warning. The Captain and First Officer held a discussion between themselves if they were feeling any symptoms of hypoxia and both pilots were free of such physiological effects. The Captain relayed to Maintenance that there seemed to be something wrong and it was the Captain's concern that the pressure vessel could exceed limitations of maximum pressurization differential and for safety of flight wanted to descend back down to 15;000 ft. At this time we were climbing through approximately 16;000 ft. Maintenance asked the Captain if the call could be forwarded to Dispatch to make sure there was enough fuel on board to safely operate the flight to ZZZ1 at a lower altitude than planned. The Captain agreed and the call was forwarded.While waiting for the call to be picked up by Operations the Captain once again did a self check and felt no physical effects of hypoxia. The Captain asked the First Officer if he was feeling hypoxic; which the First Officer stated he was not. The Captain then asked the First Officer to call the flight attendants to see if they; or the passengers were feeling off at all; which might indicate high or low pressurization problems. According to the First Officer the reports from the back were that all was seemingly normal. The flight attendants also reported that they did not hear any whooshing or whistling sounds that might indicate a leak in the pressure vessel. We had just leveled off at 20;000 ft. with no master cautions or master warnings. The pressure indication control panel read the same here as it had at the other points indicated in the climb.When Operations picked up their line they quickly ran performance numbers and we agreed that in the interest of safety we would descend to 15;000 ft. While still on the phone with Operations the Captain asked the First Officer to request a descent with ATC. This request was immediately granted; if it was not; it was this Captain's intent to [request priority handling] and inform ATC of our descent to 15;000 ft. Before we reached 15;000 ft. on our descent the Captain started feeling light headed and experienced tingling in his fingers and increased popping in his ears. When asked; the First Officer reported similar altitude effects. It was our assumption that since we were descending the symptoms would not develop too severely as we were descending into more dense air. We then called the flight attendants back and they reported similar hypoxic effects and also frequent ear popping.At about 16;000 ft.; we decided to continue our descent down to 10;000 ft. which we had no problem obtaining clearance for with ATC. At this point the Captain determined we were about 130 miles South of ZZZ1; which was our filed destination. We were also almost directly over ZZZ2. The Captain did another self assessment and felt that it was probably best to not continue to ZZZ1; but wanted to check with the rest of the crew to see how they were feeling about a diversion. The First Officer also reported that he felt like the more conservative approach was to divert to ZZZ2. The Captain specifically remembers feeling that it was irresponsible to continue the flight as planned with an undiagnosed pressurization problem; but with multiple crew members reporting symptoms of hypoxia. This Captain also thought about the fidelity of the operation and did not want to be too aggressive in a manner that would bring unneeded scrutiny on our company if the decision was made to continue and people arrived in ZZZ1 feeling sick. The Captain decided then that in the interest of safety; as the most conservative decision; the flight would divert to ZZZ2. He then called Dispatch back and informed the Dispatcher that we would be diverting to ZZZ2. The Captain asked the First Officer to request vectors from ATC back to ZZZ2 and to inform them that we would be diverting. The Captain then called the flight attendants to inform them about our upcoming change of plans and to make sure everyone in the back was feeling okay. The flight attendants reported feeling relieved that we were diverting and that nobody in the back was reporting feeling sick. This was good news and the Captain determined that emergency services would not be necessary upon landing. Descending through 10;000 ft. both the Captain and First Officer began feeling light headed and were experiencing mild cognitive decline. The pilots then took turns briefly donning oxygen masks in an attempt to raise our blood oxygen levels and stave off hypoxic effects which was helpful. The Captain made an announcement to the passengers informing them that due to a mechanical difficulty we would be making a brief stop in ZZZ1 for safety.The Captain and First Officer then came together to ensure that we were on the same page and to catch each other up. We briefed our approach and ran the descent and approach checklists. The First Officer then landed the aircraft at ZZZ2; once clearing the runway we received a parking spot from ZZZ2 operations; proceeded to the terminal and terminated our flight.This was a challenging situation to identify and manage because of the nature of the failure that we experienced. In talking with maintenance personnel in ZZZ2; the nature of the failure that we experienced; a faulty cabin pressure controller; not only provides information to the gauges we use to monitor the pressurization status of the aircraft; a component inside of it also triggers the master warning for a high cabin pressure altitude if the airplane loses pressurization. When we thought we were using independent systems to verify the pressurization status of the aircraft; we were in fact relying on the same system that was presenting multiple failures throughout many aircraft fail safes; which generate from the same place. In the future; I think it is important when dealing with an undiagnosed pressurization problem to strongly consider descending even if not presented with a cabin press master warning. Also having truly standalone pressurization reporting and pressurization warning systems is important for the safety of crew and our passengers.Reflecting on this situation I also worry that I might have fallen prey to confirmation bias. I had readings somewhat consistent with normal aircraft operation which made me comfortable continuing with the standard flight profile while at the same time using my resources; my crew; the passengers; Maintenance; and Dispatch; to diagnose the problem and make decisions. While my First Officer and I had correctly identified an undesired aircraft state existed and were actively and vigorously trying to trap and mitigate the ambiguous instrument readings and conflicting physical symptomology; stopping our climb earlier would have proven the best trap strategy. On paper these events seem somewhat far apart and isolated; being reported in thousand foot As they unfolded on the flight deck though; the events and timelines are much more compressed. For example the time between 10;000 ft. and 15;000 ft. seems dramatic but only takes a couple of minutes with the aircraft performance that we experienced on that flight day. Combined with the short nature of our flight; without the benefits of experiencing a master warning or master caution that would have driven us into different checklist driven actions; I believe we mitigated and trapped the problems with our Aircraft effectively. I believe we achieved this through quality use of CRM with amongst and between cabin crew; and with our ground based colleagues in the Maintenance and Dispatch departments.", {"entities": [[68, 78, "WEATHER"], [347, 355, "WEATHER"], [1840, 1848, "WEATHER"], [2502, 2510, "WEATHER"], [3598, 3606, "WEATHER"], [3701, 3709, "WEATHER"], [7487, 7495, "WEATHER"], [7688, 7705, "WEATHER"], [176, 189, "CREW"], [198, 203, "CREW"], [219, 226, "CREW"], [235, 240, "CREW"], [295, 304, "ALTITUDE"], [313, 318, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [327, 334, "CREW"], [401, 406, "AIRPLANE"], [542, 547, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [695, 700, "AIRPLANE"], [845, 858, "CREW"], [865, 872, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [881, 890, "ALTITUDE"], [1016, 1024, "ALTITUDE"], [1179, 1192, "CREW"], [1247, 1255, "AIRPLANE"], [1344, 1353, "AIRPLANE"], [1386, 1391, "AIRPLANE"], [1409, 1414, "AIRPLANE"], [1446, 1453, "CREW"], [1467, 1480, "CREW"], [1507, 1518, "CREW"], [1646, 1653, "CREW"], [1684, 1697, "CREW"], [1698, 1709, "CREW"], [1732, 1739, "CREW"], [2051, 2059, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2074, 2083, "ALTITUDE"], [2161, 2166, "AIRPLANE"], [2220, 2227, "CREW"], [2232, 2245, "CREW"], [2337, 2343, "CREW"], [2389, 2396, "CREW"], [2408, 2419, "CREW"], [2475, 2482, "CREW"], [2617, 2624, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2638, 2647, "ALTITUDE"], [2670, 2678, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2701, 2710, "ALTITUDE"], [2712, 2723, "CREW"], [2734, 2741, "CREW"], [2776, 2784, "CREW"], [2904, 2911, "CREW"], [3007, 3014, "CREW"], [3088, 3095, "CREW"], [3106, 3119, "CREW"], [3157, 3170, "CREW"], [3194, 3201, "CREW"], [3217, 3230, "CREW"], [3243, 3260, "CREW"], [3395, 3408, "CREW"], [3475, 3492, "CREW"], [3642, 3651, "ALTITUDE"], [3801, 3806, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3935, 3942, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3946, 3955, "ALTITUDE"], [4002, 4009, "CREW"], [4020, 4033, "CREW"], [4047, 4054, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4060, 4063, "CREW"], [4130, 4137, "CREW"], [4189, 4192, "CREW"], [4200, 4207, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4211, 4220, "ALTITUDE"], [4240, 4249, "ALTITUDE"], [4258, 4265, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4270, 4277, "CREW"], [4398, 4411, "CREW"], [4488, 4498, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4554, 4564, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4605, 4622, "CREW"], [4709, 4718, "ALTITUDE"], [4748, 4755, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4764, 4773, "ALTITUDE"], [4828, 4831, "CREW"], [4851, 4858, "CREW"], [4986, 4993, "CREW"], [5180, 5193, "CREW"], [5248, 5256, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5284, 5291, "CREW"], [5494, 5501, "CREW"], [5699, 5706, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5733, 5740, "CREW"], [5869, 5877, "CREW"], [5951, 5958, "CREW"], [5969, 5982, "CREW"], [6007, 6010, "CREW"], [6075, 6082, "CREW"], [6099, 6116, "CREW"], [6227, 6244, "CREW"], [6377, 6384, "CREW"], [6457, 6467, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6476, 6485, "ALTITUDE"], [6496, 6503, "CREW"], [6508, 6521, "CREW"], [6599, 6605, "CREW"], [6751, 6758, "CREW"], [6904, 6911, "CREW"], [6916, 6929, "CREW"], [7032, 7040, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7053, 7060, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7065, 7073, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7090, 7103, "CREW"], [7109, 7115, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [7156, 7162, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [7229, 7237, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [7394, 7405, "CREW"], [7481, 7486, "AIRPLANE"], [7682, 7687, "AIRPLANE"], [8117, 8127, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [8157, 8162, "AIRPLANE"], [8627, 8638, "CREW"], [8644, 8652, "CREW"], [8707, 8720, "CREW"], [8935, 8940, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [9069, 9082, "ALTITUDE"], [9207, 9216, "ALTITUDE"], [9222, 9231, "ALTITUDE"], [9696, 9706, "CREW"], [9752, 9763, "CREW"], [9768, 9776, "CREW"]]}],

Thus; I could not complete a leak and ops check. I notified my Supervisor and then contacted [Maintenance Control]. I explained the situation to the 767 Controller; and suggested we open a deferral against the FCU leak and operational check. [Controller] informed me that he was not authorized to issue a DMI against an already existing open deferral. He suggested I just note the open leak and ops check in the maintenance comments attached to the APU deferral. I raised my concerns/objection to this course of action primarily due to the fact that there would be no real visibility or accountability. The potential to miss a critical step seemed to be glaringly obvious. I again stated my objection; to include the possibility of taking the airplane out of service. [Controller] suggested conferencing in with Engineering to investigate any EO relief. The powerplant engineer seemed not to grasp the intent; and indicated that this is not something he could or would be inclined to provide relief for. At that point; I turned the issue over to Maintenance Supervisor. After consulting with Manager; [Supervisor] came back to me; explained that there was simply no relief for adding additional deferral; and that he had assurances that the item would be tracked; and accomplished at the first opportunity; and that again; simply adding maintenance comments to the open deferral would suffice.

	["I was flying VFR above a broken/scattered layer with tops at about 9;500 feet after having climbed above the layer. Though I get flight following on 95% of my flights; traffic was so light (due to the pandemic); that I chose not to speak with ATC this day. I knew I had to fly well south of my destination before I could descend in relatively clear conditions. As I was descending and turning to the NW; I was suddenly staring directly at a commercial jet crossing my path from right to left 3+ miles directly ahead and below less than one thousand feet. I initiated a hard turn to the right and shallow climb; and I noticed the jet banking to its right. I was surprised to see a jet in this location at this altitude; so far west of ZZZ. I fly this route often for training; but rarely above 6;000 feet; so later after landing I studied the ZZZ STARS and saw that this jet was right where it was supposed to be on the STAR. I had collected the weather soon after the traffic encounter and it was reporting 5;500 broken which equates to an MSL ceiling of 7;000; which is about where the jet was. I realize now; that the jet was descending through the cloud layer that I flew around and the jet speed was such that it must have emerged from the cloud layer during my momentary 'heads down' to get the frequencies at my destination. The encounter was rattling; and I can imagine the pilots of the jet making a colorful comment or two about general aviators. There are many obvious lessons here. Talk to ATC; maintain a traffic scan and pay closer attention to any traffic information available on the MFD. Nevertheless; I realize now that I do not have a full understanding of the STARs in my area since they are generally used by turbojet aircraft capable of 250 knots and arriving from the flight levels. In particular; I note that there are 25 STARs published for the airports under the Class B airspace.

	["Aircraft X departs ZZZ to move on station for orbits at Cal State University (VPZZZ). Aircraft X reports on station; as requested by tower and orbits at approximately 1;100 ft. to 1;300 ft. MSL.Aircraft X hears a call from Aircraft Y inbound to ZZZ and hears the Tower instruct him/her (paraphrasing): 'Enter a 4-mile right base.... there is a helicopter orbiting at Cal-State at [altitude]'.There are various exchanges between Tower; Aircraft Y and Aircraft X where Tower reports position of Aircraft Y to Aircraft X and vice versa. On each of these call Aircraft X reports 'Looking...'.At one point Tower calls Aircraft X and reports that Aircraft Y 'is one mile north'; Aircraft X reports back 'Looking' again. But Aircraft Y reports 'traffic in sight [ I believe he/she actually said 'Helicopter in sight''.Upon rounding the orbit in a direction where I could see north; Aircraft Y ends up coming visually through the bottom right chin bubble of the helicopter and we almost were directly over him by the time he was in line with the nose of the helicopter. Separation was about 500 ft. per the pilot. Passenger in back who could have only seen the airplane out his left window; (flying in a direction away from Aircraft X) says it was 300 ft.Neither pilot of either aircraft took any evasive action - it was clear at least to me that we would not hit. But it was closer than expected. And Aircraft Y was not where it was to be expected.Based on Tower's initial instruction (enter a 4-mile base); I was expecting Aircraft Y to pass east of my position and then turn straight-in to the runways. In other words; passing me at a distance further away from the airport than I was. Instead; Aircraft Y decided to 'cut the corner' at about 3 miles and make a 45 entry to final. Aircraft Y effectively tried to pass between me and the airport instead.I think it was poor judgement on the part of the Aircraft Y pilot to turn in towards the runways at Cal State; rather than continue until he/she was perpendicular to the runways before turning final. I believe that the intent from Tower; right from the first call to Aircraft Y was specifically designed to avoid exactly the situation that happened. I do not believe Aircraft Y understood the implication of the initial call up from the tower (Enter 4-mile right base.... there is a helicopter at Cal State...)Perhaps Tower could have emphasized. 'Enter a 4-mile base to final and square the base; or pass east of the helicopter before turning final')Upon analysis afterwards on the ground; Aircraft Y landed at ZZZ at XA:24 on [date].

	["I was working Local Control combined up with all positions at the airport except Controller in Charge. It was XA:25 and still dark out when the incident occurred. The airport had just switched from a north flow to a south flow. Wind was calm. I was still trying to configure my radar; keyboards and position set up for the flow change but I was having trouble with the STARS. My 2 co-workers in the tower were chipping in and helping me but they were busy doing other duties as well. I only had a few aircraft on frequency at the time but the things happening at the time were all odd situations. One aircraft didn't have their numbers holding short. I had a closure at taxiways that made it difficult to taxi aircraft from west to east and visa versa. So I had to taxi them reverse taxi to make it all work smoothly. I had a helicopter just off the departure end of the runway on a scene and maybe one arrival tagged (just guessing on that one). As I taxied Aircraft X to the runway from the west side of the airport. I noticed he wasn't tagging up on the ASDE-X and he was just a primary target only moving across the airport. So it was easy to lose him in the darkness. As Aircraft X approached the runway I started the release process. I couldn't obtain a release with TRACON using the F13/rundown list function due to the STARS keyboards not configuring correctly. So I coordinated manually with TRACON and when I did; I coordinated with the wrong position. I realized it during the coordination and corrected it and got the release from the appropriate controller for me. I scanned the runway and then cleared Aircraft X for takeoff at a taxiway which is non standard intersection. Its usually the taxiway which is right next to it. I issued Aircraft X a right turn to 240. Then I was trying to configure my keyboards and trouble shoot the issue again. I was head down just for a moment during this. I looked up to check Aircraft X and he still wasn't tagged but I barely noticed him rolling the wrong way in the dark. I also saw his primary target moving north on the ASDE-X. He was departing the wrong direction from the taxiway. There is right about 2;000 ft. of runway that direction. I immediately keyed up and with urgency and I told Aircraft X to stop. I then told him he was departing the wrong direction. He quickly stopped his aircraft and turned around. We exchanged a few words then I cleared him for take off again. He then departed without issue and went on his way. I didn't issue a pilot deviation because I know the pilot was very shaken as was I. I didn't want to add to his stress of what just happened while he was flying to his destination.Not sure if any recommendations would prevent this. The whole swiss cheese thing was in effect here. There were many distractions; odd situations; aircraft not tagging on the ASDE-X; aircraft with no numbers; taxing aircraft; helicopter; miscommunication and coordination with TRACON on my part; darkness; equipment issues etc etc. I felt the situation starting to 'spiral' very early and asked for help. My two co-workers jumped in to help soon as I asked with what they could. I became hyper vigilant and relied on experience. I would have never thought a pilot would try and depart the wrong way on a runway being so close to the end of it. This scenario has crossed my mind before in my 'what if's' I run through my head daily. Well; 'What if' happened and I got extremely lucky I caught it. I'm not sure if Aircraft X had enough runway to get airborne or not. He appeared to be going around 40 to 50 kts. when I stopped him. Scanning was the key here to prevent an incident/accident. I think if the lighting in the tower was better to read the cheat sheets would have helped me and I may have been less distracted. I think If there was a way to trouble shoot keyboard/stars configuration issues it would make it safer and streamline it all to reconfigure. You have to guess and figure out what is wrong when they keyboards don't configure. Its most likely operator error but It doesn't help you figure out what the error is to correct it quickly.

On takeoff roll; at the required 100 kts. call by the Pilot Monitoring; the airspeed indicators were observed to be in disagreement by the First Officer; the obvious indication was amber Airspeed Disagree messages on both PFDs. The First Officer verbalized 'airspeed disagree' at which time I looked at both indicators; noted the amber messages and observed my indicator to be approximately 15 kts. higher. My hand was still on the throttles and the aircraft was accelerating rapidly due to the light gross weight.

Crew had a conversation about the event and felt the aircraft was safe to taxi and informed station maintenance of the occurrence. We were directed to return to our original gate and received ATC clearance to do so. An electronic logbook entry was made; brake cooling charts referenced; and maintenance personnel were briefed. A thorough crew debrief was also conducted. Maintenance conducted an investigation of the pitot tubes and forward electronics compartment.

We experienced two times light wake turbulence from this aircraft and we communicated to VVTS that we were requesting 2NM right of track due to that turbulence. Both times we received no reply from VVTS control. A few minutes later (about 20nm East of position Dudis) we experienced a more severe wake turbulence encounter. The aircraft was pitching and rolling abruptly at that time. The bank was going past 30 degrees and probably more at the point.I disconnected the autopilot and initiated control of the aircraft. At that point the wake turbulence got more severe and I came out of my seat repeatedly. In attempts to perform the upset recovery it was difficult to maintain control and manipulate the MCP (Mode Control Panel). At this time it was very difficult to even read the flight instruments due to the severe turbulence. In the recovery we lost about 800 ft. and our altitude was FL 342 until a recovery to altitude could be initiated with manipulation of the MCP.It has to be said that during the beginning of the more severe event we tried several times (more than 10 times) to call VVTS via VHF requesting a right of track deviation. To no avail. Only until the Captain made a more [forceful] request did we get a reply from VVTS control. We informed VVTS of our altitude and our recovery back to FL 350. There were no events after the recovery to altitude. Flight proceeded as normal.\nZZZZ-ZZZZ1 (Pilot Monitoring) While outbound of DUDIS at FL350 on airway M771; we made initial contact with HoChi Minh (after several attempts). We began to experience light but persistent wake turbulence from another same direction aircraft at FL360. Noting the quartering tailwind I thought it would be prudent to turn on the continuous ignition. I advised the First Officer of my intent to request a 2-mile offset to the right which would keep us out of the wake turbulence (which was increasing in intensity by the second). After two failed attempts to get HoChi Minh to answer our radio call; the wake turbulence intensified to what I would consider moderate to severe chop. As I was making my third attempt to get a response from HoChi Minh; it felt as if the bottom dropped out and the aircraft dropped 200 ft. The aircraft then violently rolled left between 30 and 45 degrees of bank and began a significant descent (I did not note the sink rate). I noticed [the] First Officer promptly disengaged the autopilot and rolled wings level. We arrested the descent at FL342. We started a VERY slow climb back to FL350; while I again attempted to contact HoChi Minh. On this last radio call I included our current altitude and how we got there (wake turbulence from the aircraft ahead of us); and included our request to offset. HoChi Minh finally responded; acknowledged our climb back to FL350 and approved our offset as requested. We re-engaged the automation and the flight continued without incident.", {"entities": [[300, 315, "WEATHER"], [418, 428, "WEATHER"], [566, 581, "WEATHER"], [806, 821, "WEATHER"], [1089, 1099, "WEATHER"], [1858, 1873, "WEATHER"], [2130, 2145, "WEATHER"], [2271, 2286, "WEATHER"], [2916, 2931, "WEATHER"], [39, 45, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [136, 139, "ABBREVIATION"], [171, 176, "ALTITUDE"], [199, 205, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [243, 248, "ALTITUDE"], [739, 748, "AIRPLANE"], [859, 863, "AIRPLANE"], [1131, 1137, "ALTITUDE"], [1160, 1162, "ABBREVIATION"], [1374, 1377, "ABBREVIATION"], [1445, 1452, "CREW"], [1580, 1582, "ABBREVIATION"], [1726, 1731, "ALTITUDE"], [1914, 1919, "ALTITUDE"], [2032, 2045, "CREW"], [2255, 2260, "AIRPLANE"], [2479, 2485, "ALTITUDE"], [2585, 2592, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2641, 2654, "CREW"], [2679, 2688, "AIRPLANE"], [2729, 2736, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2740, 2745, "ALTITUDE"], [2770, 2775, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2784, 2789, "ALTITUDE"], [2851, 2856, "AIRPLANE"], [3047, 3052, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3061, 3066, "ALTITUDE"]]}],

	["Missed direction on company page to contact Ground for pushback. Due to similar ramp appearance to many other company-owned; uncontrolled; small; remote ramps; pushed back onto the adjacent taxiway without asking Ground. When taxi clearance was requested; Ground Control mentioned that what we thought was an uncontrolled part of the ramp; was actually a taxiway. They said there was no conflict; but to note it in the future. Apologized and continued.I believe that several factors added to the cause: Similarity to many other small ramps; my unfamiliarity with this particular airport; and; truthfully; the disruption in my normal flows and habit patterns due to the change in operations during the Coronavirus pandemic. I normally don't use my iPad for things like checking in or reading and signing the flight planning requirements. I previously exclusively relied on printed paper flight planning requirements because of the ease; accuracy; and speed of access and unmatched ability to understand the entire plan when referencing them. I also have found it faster to exclusively use the touchpad in the airplane for all in-flight info; and consider taking out and attaching the iPad to be superfluous; time-consuming; and limits visibility. During COVID Operations; I have been trying to find the best way to alter my flows and vary from proven habit patterns to comply with changing sanitation requirements and necessary technological operational changes. I believe the combination of dealing with cleaning the flight deck; reduced communication while wearing a mask and distracting tactile limitations of gloves; changes in where and how quickly pertinent information is obtained (iPad vs paper; iPad vs. Touchpad); and changes as simple as where your eyes look to get info; lead to this mistake. Simply put; I looked at the ramp depiction on the company page on the iPad; had it sized incorrectly to see the parking space only as opposed to looking at the depiction on the airplane's touchpad where I would normally look and see the requirement to call Ground for pushback; and missed it based on experience-based expectation bias.

	["Flight was filed ZZZ to ZZZ1. This was the fourth day flying with the same Captain. It was our third leg of the day and our second on [this] aircraft. Weather in both locations was clear with light winds out of the north. We pushed from the gate in ZZZ early with 13 passengers. Because of the light load; I pitched to 15 degrees on takeoff to avoid any chance of over-speeding the flaps. On the initial climb; I accelerated to 230 and continued. Through 5;000 ft.; I noted a creaking sound in the airframe and mentioned it to the Captain. Around the same time; he noted the pressurization panel. The cabin differential and cabin altitude were pegged to zero while the cabin showed a slight descent. Rapidly approaching 10;000 ft.; we noted that if we weren't pressurized; we should get a Master Warning chime through 9;800 ft. There was no warning chime. The caution panel remained dark. We began to wonder if it was the gauges that had failed. We discussed this for a moment and agreed to bring Maintenance into the situation. The Captain called Maintenance on SATCOM; and I took over ATC and continued to fly.Reaching FL200; we leveled and set cruise power. I had AUX2 turned down so I could focus on flying and ATC; so I didn't hear the Captain's conversation with Maintenance directly. Shortly after leveling; the Captain asked me to request 15;000 ft. while still on the call. The concern then was a potential overpressurization since we didn't know what the cabin differential was. I told ATC that we needed a descent to 15;000 ft. for a potential pressurization issue. We were cleared: 'Descend and maintain 16;000. Expect lower shortly.' The controller followed up by asking if we needed any assistance. I responded; 'Not at this time.' I set the alerter for 16;000; pressed ALT SEL; verified ALT SEL with the Captain while he was still on the call; and started a descent.The call with Maintenance was completed shortly after starting down; and the Captain recapped the conversation with me. Maintenance was fine with us continuing to ZZZ1 at a lower altitude. He asked for my thoughts on it. I asked if we had performance for it; and he said Maintenance checked with Dispatch and we were fine at the lower altitude. We agreed to reassess the situation at the lower altitude and make a decision from there. Shortly after; the Captain asked 'How are you feeling? I think I'm feeling a little lightheaded.' I responded; 'Yeah; I think my fingers are tingling a little. How about we go down to ten?' We agreed; and I told ATC that we needed 10;000 ft. Once we were cleared; I switched to IAS mode and reduced power to flight idle. The autopilot responded aggressively; so I disconnected it momentarily to establish the descent and reengaged it once we were stable. We used oxygen during the descent and discontinued use reaching 10;000 ft. The Captain asked the flight attendants what conditions were in the back: if the flight attendants were experiencing any symptoms; if the passengers were experiencing any symptoms; if they noticed any abnormalities or heard any hissing noises? Meanwhile; I was handed off to Approach. The Captain and I circled back. He informed me that the flight attendants had reported physiological symptoms that were commensurate with our own--starting in the descent. I don't recall any complaints from passengers; and there were no abnormal noises in the cabin. I reported that we were level at 10;000 ft. talking to [Approach] with a correct altimeter setting.At that point; we were approaching the Valley west of ZZZ2. The Captain noted that we were still at least 130 miles from ZZZ1. We both came to the conclusion that we didn't know what was wrong with the plane; specifically; and we didn't know why we weren't feeling right. Neither of us were comfortable with continuing to a higher-density airport at a lower altitude under the current circumstance. We agreed that a diversion to ZZZ2 was the best course of action. The Captain began coordinating with Dispatch; the flight attendants; and addressed the passengers. I advised ZZZ2 Approach that we needed to plan a diversion to ZZZ2; needed delay vectors; and a lower altitude. We were given present heading; 8;000 ft.; expect visual [Runway] XXL. ATC asked if we required assistance. I repeated; 'Not at this time.' By now; ZZZ2 was off of our right wing; so I slowed to 200 KIAS to allow time to set up and brief the approach and began a descent to 8;000 ft. During that time; the TRACON went through a shift change. I changed the destination in the EFB and requested performance for ZZZ2. I also set up the FMS for the RNAV XXL.Once each of us had everything taken care of; the Captain and I circled back to brief the approach. We acknowledged that [there] were several threats in front of us and outlined the visual approach backed up with the RNAV XXL. By this point; we were on a high downwind for XXL. We completed the descent and approach checklists and descended for the approach. We were left fairly high on the base turn; so I increased our descent rate until we were in a better place for the approach. The controller vectored us at a sharp angle for final and asked if we had the airport in sight. The Captain responded that we needed vectors to final; and we were given a sharp turn to intercept XXL then cleared for the visual approach. The FMS began overshooting the turn; so I disengaged the autopilot and made the corrections to get back on profile. We continued a stable approach to a normal landing. Once clear of the runway; we contacted [Operations] for a gate assignment; continued to the gate; and deplaned. After recounting the anomalies to maintenance personnel; the crew met in the back to debrief and discuss the events that had happened. No additional info needed for [this report].In the sequence of events that unfolded; it was interesting that there was no singular trigger that indicated that we were approaching a [critical situation]. Our expectation for depressurization or lack of pressurization was a CABIN PRESS annunciation associated with a Master Warning. That expectation wasn't realized; so we decided to bring Maintenance into the discussion. In the time that it took to address each level; with what seemed like appropriate action at that time; the situation escalated or more information was learned requiring a further escalation of action. I think CRM played a key role in being able to mitigate the rolling events that resulted in a diversion on an already short flight. From my perspective; it made a huge difference that the Captain had confidence in my ability to handle the airplane; our flight path; and communication with ATC. That allowed him to handle all of the communication with company and flight attendants all while keeping the passengers informed. I especially liked the fact that he continually asked for my input; opinion; and feelings on decisions. We established a collaborative environment in which we quickly assessed where we were; assigned expectations for the next few moments; completed those tasks individually; gathered information; and then circled back to evaluate and repeat the process. I also recognize that we both felt empowered; even for me from the right seat; to say I'm not comfortable with this and stop the operation. In retrospect; I am concerned that the trigger for the Master Warning failed in tandem with the instrumentation on the cabin pressure control panel. I feel like the warning system should be independent of the system itself. Given that; having the visual pressurization check on the after-takeoff flow and the cruise flow helps trap that threat. Going forward; if there's ever any question of pressurization; I would level at a lower altitude and assess the situation. In hindsight; because we hadn't received a Master Warning annunciation; we believed that we were in fact pressurized and sought additional input before making further decisions.\nOperating flight; departing ZZZ to ZZZ1; our aircraft and aircrew were in good operating order. Ceilings and visibility departing ZZZ were unrestricted and we were about to finish the final leg of our 4 day trip. The First Officer was the pilot flying and the Captain was the pilot monitoring for this leg. Just prior to passing through 10;000 ft. on our climb-out the Captain checked the pressure indication control panel which indicated the cabin was pressurizing at a rate of about 500 fpm; which isn't unusual for a departure from a near sea level airport; combined with the high climb rate of our light aircraft. What did seem odd was the readings on the other two instruments; the differential gauge was pegged at zero; as was the cabin altitude gauge. These two instruments clearly were not in agreement with each other; or with the pressurization rate gauge. In talking with the First Officer as we climbed through 10;000 ft.; we thought that another way to confirm if we were pressurizing was if the Cabin Press master warning was triggered through 9;800 ft. Also we confirmed that the bleeds and packs were on with normal flow control setting. We did discuss that we were both experiencing popping ears and the First Officer thought he might have heard a creaking noise from the airframe. As we received no master warning; we thought we were probably pressurizing as the rate indicator showed; but possibly had faulty cabin differential and cabin alt gauges. At this point this Captain informed the First Officer that he was going to call Maintenance Control to help troubleshoot the gauges and to get a second opinion as to if we were in fact pressurizing as the crew had thought. The Captain handed the radios over to the First Officer.Maintenance Control informed this Captain that there was not anything they could guide the flight crew in with respect to troubleshooting the pressure indication control panel; and that they could evaluate the system on the ground in ZZZ1 but there was not anything that could be reset or diagnosed in flight from their standpoint. At this time we were climbing through about 15;000 ft. and the panel was reading the same as it had previously; there was a slight cabin pressurization rate with no Cabin Press warning. The Captain and First Officer held a discussion between themselves if they were feeling any symptoms of hypoxia and both pilots were free of such physiological effects. The Captain relayed to Maintenance Control that there seemed to be something wrong and it was the Captain's concern that the pressure vessel could exceed limitations of maximum pressurization differential and for safety of flight wanted to descend back down to 15;000 ft. At this time we were climbing through approximately 16;000 ft. Maintenance Control asked the Captain if the call could be forwarded to Dispatch to make sure there was enough fuel on board to safely operate the flight to ZZZ1 at a lower altitude than planned. The Captain agreed and the call was forwarded.While waiting for the call to be picked up by Operations the Captain once again did a self check and felt no physical effects of hypoxia. The Captain asked the First Officer if he was feeling hypoxic; which the First Officer stated he was not. The Captain then asked the First Officer to call the flight attendants to see if they; or the passengers were feeling off at all; which might indicate high or low pressurization problems. According to the First Officer the reports from the back were that all was seemingly normal. The flight attendants also reported that they did not hear any whooshing or whistling sounds that might indicate a leak in the pressure vessel. We had just leveled off at 20;000 ft. with no master cautions or master warnings. The pressure indication control panel read the same here as it had at the other points indicated in the climb.When Operations picked up their line they quickly ran performance numbers and we agreed that in the interest of safety we would descend to 15;000 ft. While still on the phone with Operations the Captain asked the First Officer to request a descent with ATC. This request was immediately granted; if it was not; it was this Captain's intent to [request priority handling] and inform ATC of our descent to 15;000 ft. Before we reached 15;000 ft. on our descent the Captain started feeling light headed and experienced tingling in his fingers and increased popping in his ears. When asked; the First Officer reported similar altitude effects. It was our assumption that since we were descending the symptoms would not develop too severely as we were descending into more dense air. We then called the flight attendants back and they reported similar hypoxic effects and also frequent ear popping. At about 16;000 ft.; we decided to continue our descent down to 10;000 ft. which we had no problem obtaining clearance for with ATC. At this point the Captain determined we were about 130 miles South of ZZZ1; which was our filed destination. We were also almost directly over ZZZ2. The Captain did another self assessment and felt that it was probably best to not continue to ZZZ1; but wanted to check with the rest of the crew to see how they were feeling about a diversion. The First Officer also reported that he felt like the more conservative approach was to divert to ZZZ2. The Captain specifically remembers feeling that it was irresponsible to continue the flight as planned with an undiagnosed pressurization problem; but with multiple crew members reporting symptoms of hypoxia. This Captain also thought about the fidelity of the operation and did not want to be too aggressive in a manner that would bring unneeded scrutiny on our company if the decision was made to continue and people arrived in ZZZ1 feeling sick. The Captain decided then that in the interest of safety; as the most conservative decision; the flight would divert to ZZZ2. He then called Dispatch back and informed the Dispatcher that we would be diverting to ZZZ2. The Captain asked the First Officer to request vectors from ATC back to ZZZ2 and to inform them that we would be diverting. The Captain then called the flight attendants to inform them about our upcoming change of plans and to make sure everyone in the back was feeling okay. The flight attendants reported feeling relieved that we were diverting and that nobody in the back was reporting feeling sick. This was good news and the Captain determined that emergency services would not be necessary upon landing. Descending through 10;000 ft. both the Captain and First Officer began feeling light headed and were experiencing mild cognitive decline. The pilots then took turns briefly donning oxygen masks in an attempt to raise our blood oxygen levels and stave off hypoxic effects which was helpful. The Captain made an announcement to the passengers informing them that due to a mechanical difficulty we would be making a brief stop in ZZZ2 for safety.The Captain and First Officer then came together to ensure that we were on the same page and to catch each other up. We briefed our approach and ran the descent and approach checklists. The First Officer then landed the aircraft at ZZZ2; once clearing the runway we received a parking spot from Operations; proceeded to the terminal and terminated our flight. [Report] also filed. This was a challenging situation to identify and manage because of the nature of the failure that we experienced. In talking with maintenance personnel in ZZZ2; the nature of the failure that we experienced; a faulty cabin pressure controller; not only provides information to the gauges we use to monitor the pressurization status of the aircraft; a component inside of it also triggers the master warning for a high cabin pressure altitude if the airplane loses pressurization. When we thought we were using independent systems to verify the pressurization status of the aircraft; we were in fact relying on the same system that waspresenting multiple failures throughout many aircraft fail safes.", {"entities": [[4779, 4784, "WEATHER"], [7428, 7436, "WEATHER"], [8058, 8068, "WEATHER"], [8338, 8346, "WEATHER"], [9839, 9847, "WEATHER"], [10509, 10517, "WEATHER"], [11613,

	["I was the Captain on flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1. We arrived [at] the airplane for the first flight of the day (for us and the airplane) and began preparing for departure. During my before start flow I discovered the park brake pressure to be zero. This was confirmed by moving the MFD (Multi-Function Display) into reversionary mode to show an actual value which displayed '0'. I called Maintenance Control and advised them of the brake pressure issue. The Controller directed me to FSM [section] Low Park Brake Pressure. We completed procedure; returned to the flight deck; continued with our normal checklists; and departed for ZZZ1.I was [the] PM (Pilot Monitoring) for this flight. When my First Officer called 'Gear Up' I selected the gear up and observed three red gear light indications for the mains and the nose gear and also noticed that the gear were not traveling. My first thought was to look up and I observed the alternate landing gear release door panel to be open. I communicated this to my First Officer but because we were below acceleration height we continued normally. All of the appropriate flows were completed at acceleration height and I instructed my First Officer to continue climbing but level off at 10;000 ft. which was our initially assigned altitude from ATC but also it was a safe altitude to still have the gear down if the checklist wasn't complete yet. I also instructed my First Officer to keep the airspeed below 200 KIAS. I contacted ATC and told them that we needed a level off at 10;000 ft. and they allowed us to do so. I also called the flight attendants and told them we were working on getting the gear up and that there was nothing wrong with the airplane. I completed the Landing Gear Fails To Retract checklist; the gear retracted normally; and we continued to ZZZ1; the landing gear operated and indicated normally for the remainder of the flight and there was no further incident on this flight.Upon landing in ZZZ1 I contacted Maintenance Control again to advise them of what happened and they advised me to make a log entry in the logbook so they could inspect the landing gear.Now I would like to give some further background on the situation. First; we had this airplane the night before from ZZZ1 to ZZZ and the airplane was a RON. The airplane did not fly again till we got back out to the airport to fly back to ZZZ1. Going back to the zero park brake pressure issue; this was not shocking to me because this airplane had documented issues with the park brake pressure from a couple days prior. I will paraphrase the write up by saying that it was noted that the park brake pressure decreased rapidly after engine shutdown. Maintenance had inspected the system for leaks and observed the pressure for two hours and had no findings. When we parked the night before I observed the park brake pressure to be relatively normal immediately following shut down. Now having gotten back out to the airplane and seeing the park brake pressure at zero; I wasn't terribly surprised. If you look at [the] procedure in the FSM you'll notice there's a warning box prior to any items stating the need to brief the ground crew to remain clear of the main landing gear doors. I did so but in doing so I was now physically standing in the flight deck and not sitting in my seat. My First Officer and I briefly went over the procedure before we did anything so we would know what to expect. This is the first time in nearly 4 years of employment that I have had to do this procedure. We were going line by line through the procedure (or so we thought) and we thought we had done everything completely. It's obvious I missed step 3 otherwise I wouldn't be writing this report. The final step is to return the handle to the flight deck; which we did; then we continued with our normal checklists.Everything above considered; I messed up. There were at least two opportunities for me to trap this error and I missed them. I take full responsibility for the situation. To be completely honest; we were a little behind in our duties because of having to complete the park brake pressure procedure. Both my First Officer and I went out to the engine nacelle to complete this procedure since neither one of us had done it before. It was a learning experience for both of us and it was really cool to finally get to do something we learn so much about and get pounded in our heads in ground school. At the point of discovering the park brake pressure we were in the middle of our before start duties. Upon returning to the flight deck we finished the before start flows and checklist. Being that we were a little pressed for time we were under added pressure so I missed the landing gear alternate doors item on the before start checklist. I'm not one to sit here and point fingers and make excuses but being candid; we were more hurried than normal; this was immediately following a relatively short overnight; a morning show (which I'm normally a PM guy and bid away from morning trips; but I was assigned this overnight as part of all of the rescheduling going on); and all of the added stress from everything currently going on in the world. Just a lot of external pressures. I understand it's my job to protect the operation from those pressures but we aren't perfect and this is something I have to take responsibility for. Going forward; this was huge reminder for me regarding the importance of checklist discipline and really making sure that we aren't distracted from the task at hand whether that's reading a procedure line by line that's literally black and white to really making sure I'm paying attention and visually verifying the checklist items as we complete the checklist.I have just a couple recommendations. Firstly; I believe this to be an isolated issue and this was really me just being stupid and missing something easy. I don't believe this to be something that could be systemic so I don't believe major changes to the operation for the whole pilot group are necessary. That being said; I would like to see an additional step added to the end of [the] procedure to verify that the alternate release doors have been closed. I was doing all of the steps with my iPad in hand outside of the airplane. After I read step 7 and we completed it I didn't think any further about the procedure. Granted; had I not overlooked step 3 I wouldn't be writing this report; but it would be nice for there to be a verification/reminder step to double check and make sure those panels got closed after releasing the gear doors. One last recommendation; and this is extremely nit picky; the procedure has us use the pump handle in the flight deck. We did so since that's what the manual instructed us to do but everything we get taught in ground school and the placard inside the right engine nacelle say to use the pump handle that's located in the upper right side nose compartment.", {"entities": [[224, 232, "WEATHER"], [434, 442, "WEATHER"], [2407, 2415, "WEATHER"], [2515, 2523, "WEATHER"], [2629, 2637, "WEATHER"], [2743, 2751, "WEATHER"], [2845, 2853, "WEATHER"], [2980, 2988, "WEATHER"], [4109, 4117, "WEATHER"], [4470, 4478, "WEATHER"], [4678, 4686, "WEATHER"], [10, 17, "CREW"], [49, 56, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [384, 395, "CREW"], [454, 464, "CREW"], [614, 622, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [691, 704, "CREW"], [813, 817, "AIRPLANE"], [935, 947, "AIRPLANE"], [956, 960, "AIRPLANE"], [1005, 1018, "CREW"], [1175, 1188, "CREW"], [1201, 1209, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1227, 1236, "ALTITUDE"], [1285, 1288, "CREW"], [1408, 1421, "CREW"], [1471, 1474, "CREW"], [1519, 1528, "ALTITUDE"], [1578, 1595, "CREW"], [1817, 1829, "AIRPLANE"], [1976, 1987, "CREW"], [2115, 2127, "AIRPLANE"], [2280, 2283, "ABBREVIATION"], [2306, 2309, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2355, 2358, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2662, 2668, "AIRPLANE"], [2679, 2690, "CREW"], [2795, 2801, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3194, 3206, "AIRPLANE"], [3310, 3314, "AIRPLANE"], [3319, 3332, "CREW"], [4137, 4150, "CREW"], [4173, 4179, "AIRPLANE"], [4703, 4715, "AIRPLANE"], [5998, 6003, "CREW"], [6822, 6828, "AIRPLANE"], [6903, 6907, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["Captain and First Officer; who were serving as the flight crew between ZZZ and ZZZ1 experienced a gear malfunction when the landing gear failed to retract when the landing gear selector was selected 'up.' It was subsequently determined that the Landing Gear Alternate Release was not fully closed.Prior to flight it was determined that the Park Brake pressure was below 500 psi. Per the originating checklist; the crew referenced the flight manual; section 7; Supplementary Normal Procedures.After referencing the Low Park Brake Pressure section of section 7; the crew followed Procedure 2. While performing these steps; both crew members exited the crew compartment in order to actuate the Brake Auxiliary Pump. Once sufficient park brake pressure had been achieved; the crew returned to the flight compartment and continued their preparations for departure. During a subsequent crew debrief; it was determined that the crew had overlooked step 3; which instructed the closure of the Landing Gear Alt Release Door.After takeoff when the gear failed to retract; the crew immediately determined the cause of the failure was due to the Landing Gear Alternate Release not being fully closed. The crew continued the departure and completed the remainder of the after takeoff checklist. The crew continued the climb to their initial altitude of 10;000 feet where they leveled off and maintained airspeed below 200 knots. The crew then referenced the checklist and completed the 'Landing Gear Fails to Retract' checklist; which resulted in the successful retraction of the landing gear. The flight continued to ZZZ1.Modify 'Low Park Brake Pressure' procedure 2. It is very easy to overlook step 3 due to frequent use of capital letters in steps 1; 2; and 3. Consider using bold text for step 3. Also; add a step 8 to verify step 3. When the crew needs to exit the aircraft; it creates a sense of urgency upon returning to meet departure time.

Unless there are passengers traveling together; this would cause 5 passengers to share a row with strangers.2 un-accompanied minors were on the flight; fortunately siblings. They sat together in a row.  But FA-Y refused to allow the children to sit in 'the first row with tray tables;' as required; so they were seated in the first open row; row 4.  FA-Z briefed them for the location of doors; lavatories; etc. FA-Z also instructed them that they could get FA attention by any means necessary if they needed help.As the passengers filed in; FA-Y fiercely guarded rows 1-3 and 22-24 to ensure that no passengers were seated in those spaces.  There were two other pairs traveling together; but 2 rows ended up being occupied by very uncomfortable passengers sitting with a stranger.It doesn't really make sense to block the last three rows.  On this aircraft; FA-A is 6' away from the last row.  On the other type of aircraft; FA-A and FA-B can easily be 6' apart on their individual jumpseats; and 6' from cabin seating.FAs are using the last three rows to comfortably sit in the cabin watching electronic devices (with headphones or earbuds) or immerse in non-work reading materials from the end of sterile flight deck at 10k ascent to the beginning of sterile flight deck at 10k descent.FAs seem to think that they are no longer responsible for monitoring customer behavior and assuring safety and compliance.  They would be unaware of customer illness or injury; human trafficking; destructive or threatening behavior.FAs working Y position seem to think that they have no responsibility other than initial equipment check; safety demo; and securing the cabin for final descent.  FA-Y did not double check the galley and entry while FA-A did initial and final compliance walk-throughs.Has Operations been asked to announce that the first and last three rows will be unavailable for passenger seating?  FAs are NOT required to cordon off these rows.  Operations should not be announcing that no customers will be permitted to occupy these rows.  If they have been asked to include this in announcements; it should be that 'Some rows may be blocked to prevent passenger seating.  Please inform your flight attendants if you have a special need to sit in a blocked area.' Remind FAs and Operations that we are REQUIRED to accommodate pre-boarders in the rows of their preference. Communication should be sent to FAs to remind them of requirements for un-accompanied minors and instructing of any changes due to COVID exceptions.There was no indication in any of the regulatory changes that un-accompanied minors seating requirements have been changed.  Please address this issue and clarify to crews. FAs need to remember that customer comfort and safety is still important.  If the number of passengers exceeds the number of half-rows available; FA-Y should occupy XD; and FA-A and FA-B should occupy their respective jumpseats during the flight to allow as many passengers as possible to maintain social distancing. The exception allowing the last three rows to be blocked should be eliminated.  This is not necessary for social distancing. The exception allowing the last 3 rows to be blocked is providing an invitation to FAs to occupy themselves with electronic devices or non-work related reading materials. Again; there is no safety need to block these rows.  Also; FAs need to be reminded that the prohibition of electronic device use and headphones/earbuds during duty is still in force. FAs need to be reminded that customer safety is still a high priority.  Discontinuing service does not mean that we discontinue customer care.  FAs should be sent a communication reminding them that one FA is required to be in view of customers at all times; and that customers should be checked on at least every 15 [20?) minutes.Communication should be sent out reminding FA that the Y should still double check the forward entry/galley during initial and final walk throughs; even if they do not intend to occupy the fwd jump seat.", {"entities": [[1150, 1155, "AIRPLANE"], [1224, 1229, "AIRPLANE"], [1425, 1432, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1801, 1806, "AIRPLANE"], [1817, 1824, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2344, 2361, "CREW"], [4170, 4174, "AIRPLANE"]]}],

	["Approaching DWH from the Southwest I developed a mental movie of the set up for runway 17L; with a left downwind entry. Starting the chain of errors on my part I believe I asked for RW 17R; not 17L. Tower cleared me for a right downwind 17R; which I acknowledge; but the mental movie of my approach and landing was so strong I continued with 'my' plan and crossed over the departure end of the field for the left downwind; RW 17L. Although I read back the tower clearance correctly I did not properly process what they told me because of the incredibly strong expectation to be cleared for 'my' plan. Tower asked; in a nice way; where are you going? I repeated their previous instructions; right downwind for 17R all the time playing my mental movie which was telling me I was in the right place. I was turning base for 17L when tower explained I was to be on the other side of the airport. If you can remember old time images of movie film getting stuck in the projector and melting that's how I feel. Tower had me climb immediately on a westerly heading as there was a corporate jet starting its take off roll. I don't know my exact altitude crossing runway 17R but I would estimated 700 feet AGL as I crossed over the jet on its takeoff roll.My airline training taught me to be as efficient with my approach and landing; minimizing the taxi time to the gate. I was doing the same thing in my little Cessna and locked my self in to completing that task as I saw it. I will no longer create that mental movie of what I want before I talk to the tower.

	["Taxied to incorrect runway while dealing with poor radio quality. Went to ZZZ to update databases in newly installed avionics and after recent completed annual. Had no intentions of flying and only slightly considered starting the engine to see that the engine monitor was working. Didn't want to go flying because: The winds were gusty; above my personal minimums. [The] new avionics were going to be a distraction as a single pilot. Didn't want to involve instructor to abide to social distancing. Recent flight time was low: have only had 1 hour of solo time in my aircraft. No hours in [a month] for avionics repair and annual. [I] had comms trouble before with a malfunctioning secondary EDM (Engine Data Management) - considered that perhaps comms interference was caused by bad EDM.A young passenger was with me and was a distraction. Pulled the plane out of the hanger to get GPS signal. I wanted to also check if fuel flow information was being reported from the EDM to the IFD (Integrated Flight Deck) - that meant I needed to start the engine. So; on a whim decided that it would be good to run the airplane for a while and taxi around to break in new brakes and verify things are ok after the annual.  And so it began -- I called Ground on comm 1 and told my intentions to taxi up X; down Y; and then back up X to park again. In my head I expected to head east up X; cross [Runway] XY. Then down Y.; cross [Runway] XY; then back up X. I did not hear a response on comm 1. I called for a radio check 2 more times on comm 1. After barely hearing a response on comm 1 decided to try comm 2 - my head now boiling with frustration over the newly installed malfunctioning radio.I called Ground on comm 2 and was able to get a clearance. I wrote down and repeated the clearance... Taxi to Runway XY; via X; hold short X1. Note that this is opposite my expectations. Not realizing it; and grumbling about the radio failures; I proceeded east towards Runway XY. This is the pilot deviation. I did not hear a call that was made that I was heading the wrong way; and an offer to either turn around; or cross. I heard another call that sounded like further taxi instructions; but I didn't understand what was being said; except that I should use X6. I turned onto X6 and stopped at the hold short line as I wasn't sure I was cleared to cross. The Controller listed out some instructions; which I miss heard and asked that I would take it one step at a time. Next clearance I understood enough to cross the Runway to Y6 down Y. There was more; but I just repeated that part I understood that got me down Y.When I got down to the run-up area on Y; near Y6; I stopped and called for further clearance to cross. I heard no responses. After listening to the recording at home; I heard the further clearance prior to my arrival to the run-up area; but actually did not hear responses to my calls. I made several calls; both on comm 1 and comm 2.At this point a little panic set in. How the heck was I going to get back across the runway without comms. OK lost comms procedures; in the slight panic/frustration; did not even think about a checklist...I proceeded to squawk 7700; thinking I was squawking the lost comms code.I eventually got a hold of him on the Tower frequency. I was cleared across and back to the hangar area. I made a few more radio checks on the way back; and things were still iffy - but I was done at this point. No one asked me to; but after putting the plane back in the hangar; I got the phone number to the Tower from the FBO. I called; to hear what they thought happened; but the crew had changed out while I was hangaring the plane. The current Controller said no big deal was made of it.It wasn't until I got home; where I re-read my clearance notes that I realized I had taxied the wrong way.Contributing problems [included] a lack of currency/experience. Radio problems caused frustration and distractions. Stress. Dismissive: this will just bea simple taxi - I'm not flying. Corrective actions [would include to] consider that taxing can be just as complicated as being airborne. IMSAFE applies to both on the ground or airborne.I - illness; nope.M - meds are good.S - Stress - oh yeah I'm stressed. COVID shutdown; kids at home; work from home; couldn't fly for months because of bad avionics install. This is why I wasn't going to 'fly.' A - alcohol - zip.F - fatigue; well rested.E - emotions - did I mention stress; also dismissed that taxing could be just as challenging as flying.Review lost comms procedures. I'm printing a label for the squawk codes to stick on my transponder. Pretty sure I don't remember the Tower light signals; either. I called my instructor for ideas and he also suggested that I could have used my cell phone to call the Tower (even though; at the time I didn't have the number.) Really listen to clearances. They may not be what you are expecting. Before rolling; physically point to the direction of clearance; and verify with some outside evidence that it is the correct direction.", {"entities": [[0, 6, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [20, 26, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [51, 56, "AIRPLANE"], [231, 237, "AIRPLANE"], [254, 260, "AIRPLANE"], [300, 306, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [428, 433, "CREW"], [884, 887, "AIRPLANE"], [1047, 1053, "AIRPLANE"], [1135, 1139, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1242, 1248, "CREW"], [1285, 1289, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1326, 1330, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1499, 1504, "AIRPLANE"], [1678, 1683, "AIRPLANE"], [1693, 1699, "CREW"], [1913, 1918, "AIRPLANE"], [1977, 1982, "CREW"], [2347, 2357, "CREW"], [3024, 3030, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3255, 3260, "CREW"], [3309, 3315, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3340, 3345, "AIRPLANE"], [3489, 3495, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3527, 3532, "CREW"], [3542, 3545, "ABBREVIATION"], [3667, 3677, "CREW"], [3795, 3801, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3993, 3999, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4281, 4284, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4360, 4363, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4599, 4610, "AIRPLANE"], [4645, 4650, "CREW"], [4778, 4783, "CREW"]]}],
	["Thank you for all the work you're undoubtedly doing these days. A concern; which probably has been brought up; but I hope our safety guys are working on it actively.  Well; two concerns; related.1 - Masks.  Judging from my last trip; most pilots and FAs are not wearing masks at all.  I know that the official guidance has shifted; but it really seems that our Company could do a better job of promoting the idea that wearing masks isn't to protect yourself as much as it is to protect others; in case you're infected and don't know it.  Unless we get better and clearer guidance and expectations; I don't expect pilots to all of the sudden decide it is time to wear masks.  It goes against a lot of deeply ingrained western norms.It seems that many have the idea that if you can't get 100% protection; why bother.  We're in the cockpit so who cares about on the van or in the airport.  I think this is exactly wrong; apparently the 'viral load' is important and anything that reduces your 'initial dose' could lessen the severity of any subsequent illness.  Apparently this is one reason they suspect that lots of healthy/young doctors/nurses are getting pretty bad cases; because they have so much exposure.  Which brings me to the related concern?2 - Cockpit social distancing.  It is obviously impossible to properly social distance while flying with another pilot in the cockpit.  The problem [is]; the furthest away we can possibly get is 2 feet.  That's an issue; I'm not aware of any other work environment that is so close and wearing a mask is currently prohibited.  We need Company and Union and FAA Safety all to push and approve masks in the cockpit.  Presumably someone could run a pretty quick experiment in a high altitude pressure chamber where they test various masks versus blood oxygenation using pulse oximeters.  I'm pretty certain that surgical type masks wouldn't present a problem; the N95s or homemade ones might as they could interfere with the seal; but a surgical mask seems benign on that count.  Anyway; if Company and the FAA for that matter; really intend to keep the airlines flying; then they need to relax this mask in the cockpit rule and explicitly approve it. We can't maintain 6 feet and most of us aren't wearing a mask.  So a Pilot who wears one is protecting the guy he's flying with; but if his Co-Pilot isn't wearing one; it sort of defeats the purpose.", {"entities": [[1739, 1747, "WEATHER"], [1817, 1822, "WEATHER"], [239, 245, "CREW"], [613, 619, "CREW"], [829, 836, "AIRPLANE"], [1343, 1349, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1363, 1368, "CREW"], [1376, 1383, "AIRPLANE"], [1445, 1451, "ALTITUDE"], [1607, 1610, "ABBREVIATION"], [1655, 1662, "AIRPLANE"], [2054, 2057, "ABBREVIATION"], [2110, 2116, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2159, 2166, "AIRPLANE"], [2217, 2223, "ALTITUDE"], [2315, 2321, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["Initial pairing was brought to my attention the night prior. After reviewing the assignment and forecast winter weather for the following day; an earlier commute was needed to deal with icing conditions. Having left my residence at XA00 for an XD00 hours show; I encountered winter weather driving condition along with a longer commute. Arriving at ZZZ by XD00 hours I noticed the first delay with the flight being pushed until XF00 hours.The Captain and I boarded the aircraft a little after XG00 hours. While entering the forward galley we observed a pool of liquid coming out of the right oven. Maintenance and catering were both notified and a fix was attempted. At approximately XH00 hours maintenance began a series of unusual activity. Running both engines at the gate as well as removing equipment from the cabin. This was our first indication that the aircraft was not ready for ferry. During this time we were in communication with dispatch and Maintenance Control trying to secure a Maintenance Ferry Document. At approximately XI:40 we were advised the departure was being pushed until XN:30 hours for deep cleaning. The Captain and I walked over to the hotel for lunch and received a room at approximately XJ00 hours. Agreeing to meet in the lobby at XL:30 hours for our new departure; a nap was not taken as we continued to try and track down hotel accommodations for later that night; get information for a point of contact in ZZZ1 and confirm transportation for travel to ZZZ2.At XL:45 hours we were advised of a new departure time of XO:30 as the plane was still not ready for ferry; due to maintenance sign off and Ferry Documentation. By XO:45 the Captain was at his decision point as a disagreement between Dispatch and Maintenance Control had developed preventing the Ferry Documentation being provided for a legal departure. At approximately XP00 hours I reviewed my own fitness and determined I was still at least 2 hours from departure and dealing with winter weather and maintenance. I felt I would not be able to get suitable sleep until approximately XV00 hours and this was pushing the limits to my own fitness in dealing with the threats of flying late at night; icing/weather challenges and the threat of fearing and aircraft vs. normal line operations. It was then that I decided a fatigue call would be the safest course of action.\nEveryone is stressed out by the Coronavirus Crisis. The Maintenance Controller was working from home and might not have been able to generate a maintenance ferry document from home. He finally generated one. The aircraft had been parked for over 3 weeks; probably without adequate prep for that length of time which probably caused the leaks under the ovens. ZZZ Maintenance is overworked and understaffed to properly prepare multiple aircraft (that had been parked for weeks) at short notice and with new aircraft disinfecting processes just established. Unfortunately; I won't let ZZZ Maintenance; Maintenance; Dispatch and the Operations Manager make decisions that result in an unsafe flight or an unsafe operation; especially when I've been up for over 14 hours and I've got another 4 hours to go and fly into my Window of Circadian Low (WOCL).

	["After being cleared for takeoff on Runway XXL; I began to push the thrust levers forward; noted the (left) engine N1 stabilized at 40 percent; then continued to advance the thrust levers to take-off thrust. As the engine spooled up; the aircraft began to yaw and I immediately reduced the thrust to idle; realizing we had not started the second engine. During the pre-departure briefing; I had indicated that we would taxi on two engines since it would be a short taxi from our gate to the runway. Later; after we had pushed back from the gate and started the first engine; I failed to direct the First Officer to start the second engine before we began to taxi. I believe this first error occurred because I was preoccupied; considering when I would call for certain checklists (the runway/performance change checklist and the before takeoff checklist); since the taxi would be so short. When I called for the before takeoff checklist; I recall checking the takeoff parameters above the engine indications; but failed to see that the second engine was not running. I always re-scan particular items when ATC clears us for takeoff or to 'line up and wait'; one of these being the engine indications; to ensure that both are running as we cross the runway hold-short lines. Another item I scan at this time is the FMA (Flight Mode Annunciator); to ensure that I have pressed the TOGA button and the appropriate modes are displayed. In this case; I saw that the FMA was not populated; so I pressed the TOGA button to correct the problem. I believe this distracted me from re-scanning the engine indications as I was mentally reprimanding myself for forgetting to populate the FMA. It is very odd that I did; in fact; watch the left engine spool up without noticing that the right engine was not running. I had never realized that I have been fixating on the left engine during takeoff.The main causes are short taxi time; preoccupation with upcoming tasks; and failure to redirect my attention back to planned tasks after being distracted.

	["I was CA (Captain) flying [the] visual approach to Runway 27R tracking ILS 27R. Daylight/Dusk VMC. We were cleared to land and no traffic in sight as previous landing traffic had cleared. After landing in the rollout phase Tower said go around! My initial thought was that [there was] someone landing behind us and was too close. I then happened to look down the runway and see an aircraft taxi onto the runway further down about 2000 ft. I was in reverse with full flaps and spoilers at about 80 kts. when my First Officer stated I think Tower said go around. Almost immediately I keyed the mic and said we have November (N) Taxiway; just before my planned exit K4. As I exited at November; I saw the aircraft continue to slowly cross 27R from the vicinity of Tango Taxiway.Tower instructed us to monitor a frequency for a phone number to call after arrival at [the] gate. The gravity of the situation did not appear evident until after both myself and my First Officer debriefed the situation and agreed that we were cleared to land and there was no traffic in sight until after landing. We both agreed that we could not 'go around' from a landing configuration with full flaps; in reverse; and spoilers deployed after landing.This safety error/event happened either due to an excursion by another aircraft onto the active runway by mistake or misunderstood ATC clearance. We were cleared to land and [with] no traffic visible on [the] runway; we landed normally. While we were in the rollout decelerating; tower either by mistake or confusion told us to go around with traffic on the runway less than 2000 ft. ahead. This runway excursion event happened by error. I believe either the flight misunderstood hold short or was not familiar with the taxiway configuration. Or; ATC gave a clearance that was incorrect and or got distracted with the taxiing aircraft movement. In any case; I saw the aircraft on the runway in time to slow and exit early. There was no way to do a go around from full landing configuration while in reverse; slowing; with full flaps; spoilers and on brakes.The remaining distance 2000 ft. or less would not be enough to reconfigure to a take off condition. If so; there is no way to get safely airborne and clear intruder traffic in that distance. We did the safest action which was to stop and clear the runway.\nI was the monitoring pilot during landing. Just after landing; spoilers were deployed; reverse thrust was being used and the aircraft was slowing through about 80 to 90 kts. We heard the Tower say to go around. I wasn't sure he was talking to us; but I looked up and saw an aircraft crossing the far end of the runway. Trying to execute a go around at the current energy state of the aircraft and trying to clear the other aircraft would've been very hazardous.

	["With more than 11 hours of rest; this was the last leg of the day. [I] performed pre departure inspection and departed. During climb out everything was normal. Departure Controller assigned me 8;000 ft. as final cruise altitude. Upon reaching 8;000 ft. I checked my engine instruments and performed cruise flow and checklist. After completion of checklist; I took ATIS information. While I [was] listening [to] the ATIS the aircraft suddenly became uncoordinated; requiring left rudder (ball almost out of the center parameter). I confirmed this by checking my turn coordinator [on the] Captain side. I corrected almost immediately with my feet. I reached over [to] the rudder trim knob and corrected. In less than 1 minute I sensed the aircraft [behaving oddly]. I looked over and the aircraft was uncoordinated again. I reached over to look at the First Officer's side turn coordinator to double check if my turn coordinator was inoperative or something was going on with my left side turn coordinator. After seeing both instruments were indicating correctly; to the same side. (Ball completely left outside the center); I re-checked all the engine instruments for a difference in power/torque; they both matched at 1100 torque; RPM 1900.I corrected the situation with my feet immediately and once again reached out to the rudder trim knob and attempted to correct the issue; but the rudder trim wheel turned out to be loose and separated from the center console position. At this time; I realized that controlling the airplane was going to be difficult. I kept my feet on the left rudder crosschecking my position. I asked ATC to give me a vector around some weather ahead and at the same time told ATC 'I am having flight control problems; give 1 minute to assess the situation' and he vectored me around the weather. While doing this; I was controlling rudder inputs to maintain coordinated flight; rudder control just felt weird in their feedback. I requested lower altitude and I was assigned 2;500 ft. I performed my descent and approach checklist. Upon reaching 6;000 ft. I placed almost full left rudder to maintain coordination. At this moment I realized that the situation has [worsened] too much and safety can be compromised. I [advised] ATC and also called Dispatch letting them know the aircraft [problem]. Level at 2;500 ft.; I saw the airport and I determined that I was going to perform the visual approach and briefed myself once again for the visual approach. I asked Approach for delay vectors for the visual; they vectored me southwest from the airport while I was thinking if there's something to correct the situation or [to] help me make a coordinated landing. I took feedback from Maintenance and our Chief Pilot and my last plan was prepping the cabin for the worst. After taking a few moments to go over all my possible scenarios; I told Approach I was ready for the visual approach. He cleared me for the visual approach and switched me to Tower. I called Tower for the check in and immediately received landing clearance. Performed [the] before landing checklist; I was constantly on a skidding motion to the runway; I was trying not to place full rudder input because I was unaware what was going on with the rudder and trying to avoid [worsening] the situation. I noticed while maintaining 120 kts. my rudder input while I was descending to the runway [was] more effective. Around 500 ft.; I placed flaps down and around 200/100 ft. the aircraft became very difficult to control. It was on a strange yawing movement; slipping dive to the runway. I immediately executed [the] missed approach. During initial climb out [the] ball centered and felt like everything was normal.After the hand off with Approach and with completion of all checklists; I requested another visual approach. This time I tried flaps 30 with a little more airspeed since on my first approach I noted slowing down caused me more issues in controlling the aircraft near touchdown. I stayedon 120 and flaps 30 and applied left rudder pressure to maintain coordinated flight all the way to the runway threshold and landed successfully and safely. On the ground I used differential braking and thrust to maintain runway centerline. I exited the runway. Fire Rescue was waiting for me at the taxiway. No action from them [was] required. After landing aircraft steering was operating normal and forward movement of the aircraft was found normal; [I] decided to taxi the airplane by own power to our ramp. After exiting the airplane paramedics offered medical attention; which I denied since I was fine and I didn't suffer from any injuries. After post flight inspection aircraft exterior was found normal. Post flight action included Chief Pilot conversation; aircraft maintenance logbook write up; company safety report and [this] report.", {"entities": [[1662, 1669, "WEATHER"], [1813, 1820, "WEATHER"], [4036, 4044, "WEATHER"], [110, 118, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [127, 132, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [160, 169, "CREW"], [170, 180, "CREW"], [193, 201, "ALTITUDE"], [212, 218, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [243, 251, "ALTITUDE"], [266, 272, "AIRPLANE"], [299, 305, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [364, 368, "ABBREVIATION"], [415, 419, "ABBREVIATION"], [587, 594, "CREW"], [637, 644, "ALTITUDE"], [850, 863, "CREW"], [1144, 1150, "AIRPLANE"], [1271, 1278, "ALTITUDE"], [1398, 1403, "AIRPLANE"], [1564, 1571, "ALTITUDE"], [1626, 1629, "CREW"], [1702, 1705, "CREW"], [2000, 2008, "ALTITUDE"], [2025, 2032, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2037, 2045, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2071, 2079, "ALTITUDE"], [2252, 2255, "CREW"], [2272, 2280, "CREW"], [2332, 2340, "ALTITUDE"], [2410, 2425, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2464, 2479, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2489, 2497, "CREW"], [2708, 2719, "CREW"], [2774, 2779, "AIRPLANE"], [2867, 2875, "CREW"], [2896, 2911, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2935, 2950, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2970, 2975, "CREW"], [2986, 2991, "CREW"], [3034, 3041, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3140, 3146, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3327, 3330, "ABBREVIATION"], [3360, 3370, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3378, 3384, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3414, 3420, "ALTITUDE"], [3454, 3464, "ALTITUDE"], [3571, 3577, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3608, 3623, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3632, 3645, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3730, 3738, "CREW"], [3798, 3813, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3888, 3896, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3973, 3982, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4095, 4101, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4102, 4111, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4116, 4122, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4213, 4219, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4220, 4230, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4245, 4251, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4291, 4298, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4342, 4349, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4459, 4463, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4497, 4501, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4767, 4778, "CREW"]]}],
	["During our flight from ZZZ1-ZZZ we were cleared to descend via the ZZZZZ Arrival into ZZZ1. Due to the Coronavirus there was a logistical situation developing at our destination that ultimately resulted in our being stuck at the destination without transportation; and me and the Captain were actively engaged in conversation trying to solve that issue. The bottom of the descent on the ZZZZZ Arrival is 11;000 feet. The aircraft had leveled at 11;000 feet and then a short while later I noticed the vertical path indicator descending indicating we were passing through the descent point for the proper descent path. Due to being focused on the conversation at hand; I was confused as to the state of the aircraft on the arrival. I had lost situational awareness to the fact the aircraft had already leveled at the bottom of the arrival and assumed we still had more altitude to lose. I questioned the situation asking the PM what the deal was and why we were not descending. The PM was trying to determine the issue and at that point I initiated a descent. Almost immediately we both realized that the aircraft had been level at the correct and final altitude on the arrival and I immediately initiated a climb back to 11;000 feet; which was our clearance limit. Unfortunately; we had descended to 10;500 feet during the process.After the fact we realized that the issue happened because the PM had put a crossing altitude at the airport for planning purposes and that was generating the vertical guidance that caught my attention and caused me to get confused. We had not discussed the altitude put in at the airport yet due to the discussion pertaining to the logistics developing at the destination. The issue was completely my fault. I should not have initiated a descent without first confirming the state of the aircraft on the arrival. In the attempt to keep from getting high; I caused us to actually get too low. This is also a good reminder to deal with ground issues on the ground or in downtime during cruise; and not during the arrival or later phases of flight. We were not in sterile cockpit but it was not the right time to be dealing with the logistic problems; at least not the PF!Going forward; Coronavirus or not; I have to focus on the appropriate phase of flight and not get distracted by issues on the ground while in critical phases of flight; like the arrival.", {"entities": [[51, 58, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [280, 287, "CREW"], [372, 379, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [404, 415, "ALTITUDE"], [445, 456, "ALTITUDE"], [514, 523, "AIRPLANE"], [524, 534, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [574, 581, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [603, 610, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [964, 974, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1049, 1056, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1206, 1211, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1220, 1231, "ALTITUDE"], [1286, 1295, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1299, 1310, "ALTITUDE"], [1769, 1776, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2015, 2021, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2100, 2107, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["In cruise at 33000 ft. as we were preparing for an approach briefing we received a 'L WSHLD HEAT' caution message. I asked the First Officer to keep flying the airplane and to take the radios while I ran the QRH. While running the QRH for L Windshield heat Caution we noticed a discolored line running vertically up the middle or the left windshield from the bottom to just past the mid height of the windshield. I looked closer and could see it was a small crack starting. I switched procedures and ran the QRH for non EICAS 'Window/Windshield (Arcing; Delaminated; Shatter; or Crack)' Per procedure I turned off left windshield heat; switched cabin pressure controller to manual; and began to climb the cabin pressure to lower delta P. As soon as the cabin began to climb the windshield shattered with a loud bang.I advised the First Officer we needed to descend as a precaution and he coordinated with ATC to start down. While descending I slowed the rate of cabin climb and noted we still had control and that pressurization still did not appear to be an issue. Passing through 27000 ft. we received a 'Cabin Alt' caution as the cabin climbed above 8;000 ft.; I noted delta P still above 6.2. I stopped climbing the cabin at 9000 ft. cabin altitude to avoid inadvertently deploying the passenger oxygen masks and asked the First Officer to expedite our descent to lower delta P; cabin pressure held at 9000 ft. We continued our descent to 10;000 ft. as a precaution; I notified Dispatch of the situation; they requested we return to ZZZ. We coordinated with ATC and returned.

	["I was the X Flight Attendant on flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1. With only 2 passengers the operations Agent came down to ask if we were ready to board. I said no we don't need to board 30 minutes early with only 2 people. Agent was pressured by management to still board at the normal time of 30 minutes prior to departure time. Again I explained that we do not need to board this early. I even told the Agent that I had not confirmed that the safety checks were done yet and started walking to the back of the aircraft. Agent asked 'How long is that going to take?' To which I replied 'I don't know maybe 10 minutes.' Even though I had not indeed confirmed the safety checks had been performed; I honestly was trying to hold Agent up from boarding with this as a stall tactic. As I walked towards the back Agent yelled out 'Are you guys ready?' to the flight attendants in the back to bypass me. I can only assume Agent was actually feeling pressured to board this early when anybody clearly knows that boarding 2 people will take at most 5 minutes. I believe with the current pandemic going on we could better limit ourselves to exposure by relaxing our boarding times. It is in our best interest to board people as late as possible right now. As the X Flight Attendant I am required to stand in the front of the aircraft for boarding and this forces me to be in close proximity to somebody that sits in the front. And upon boarding; the one passenger did take the first available seat to him which was row X. Had this person been disabled and required the first row seats I am required to let that individual sit there and expose me to them as well as expose them to me. Even more so than I was with the gentleman on my flight.

	["I was flying along in IMC at 5000 ft. I entered a cloud and it immediately started to rain and I started to experience choppy air that started to bounce us around a little bit. A few seconds later I noted that my VSI started to indicate a 1500 ft. per minute descent. The plane started to veer to the right and the airspeed indicator went from 120 mph to over 140 mph with no input from myself. I started to feel that the airplane was falling out of the sky. Since I was in IMC I began to say to myself trust your instruments because my body was feeling something was very wrong and I started to repeat that phrase 'trust your instruments' about 7 or 8 times. I got the plane back to level flight according to my attitude indicator and turn and slip indicator but the plane was showing a 1500 ft. per minute descent and while I was holding the plane straight and level it then went to a 1500 ft. per minute climb. My airspeed went back to normal at 120 mph but the vertical speed indicator then went from a 1500 climb to a 1500 ft. descent.At that point ATC called and advised me to check my altitude looking at my altimeter from the cockpit footage it shows that I had lost 300 ft. in a matter of a few moments. When ATC called I advised them that 'this cloud has me in a spin can I go lower and have 3000 ft.' They stated negative due to traffic and that I was IFR and I needed to maintain 5000 all while fighting the plane to stay straight and level. I was looking at my instruments and the plane was beginning to lose more altitude. ATC advised that I needed to maintain 5000.They then advised that I can't dodge the clouds I need to stay at 5000 ft. I was still fighting to recover the plane.

	["After an uneventful flight we were returning to ZZZ. We were in contact with ZZZ Approach flying at 4500 ft.. About 11-12 miles out on an approximate 240 course we were cleared to start the descent. I reduced power to about 2300 RPM and started a slow descent.  At about 2200 ft.  we were handed off to Tower and told to make straight in for [Runway XX]. About 4 minutes later and 5 miles out; just as we were cleared to land [Runway XX]; we experienced a nearly total loss of power. At that time we were flying at about 1300 ft. and at 100 MPH. Without any obvious warning engine RPM fell from about 2100-2200 RPM to 1000 RPM. The power loss was quick without any unusual engine sounds. At the time engine carb heat was already pulled and boost pump was on; mixture setting was full rich. I was unable to get the engine to produce enough power to sustain altitude and performed an uneventful landing on the dry concrete river bed. There were no injuries to myself or one other passenger and the aircraft did not sustain any damages.Engine was successfully restarted on the ground about an hour and a half following the landing. Once the aircraft was moved to the airport; aircraft was started and taxied on its own power to the tied down area. Further examination of the engine and fuel systems will be performed.Preliminary examination of the engine did not reveal any problems. There was about an hour and a half reserve of fuel at the time of the incident. The current theory is that we experienced a nearly total loss of power due to accumulation of carb ice. Weather conditions at ZZZ at the time were: sky clear; visibility 10+; 22C; 37% relative humidity; wind at about 2 kts from NNW.It is possible that I pulled carb heat too late and enough ice accumulated by that point to cause the loss of RPM. Additionally I believe that I made a serious error in judgement deciding to descend this low while being relatively far away from the airport. If I were to stay at about 2500 ft. I would have been able to make the airport even after a drastic engine power loss. Additionally there would have been more time to allow carb ice to melt.

Thinking I misheard the airport identifier; I asked again for the airport code and when I heard ZZZ2 again; I successfully entered ZZZ2 without the K and was able to see I was 4 miles away.

	["I have flown the visual to Runway 8 at ITO a few times. Was aware from experience and briefing materials that it is difficult to be wings level at 1000 ft. It was the FOs (First Officer) first time flying the arrival. I stressed this point on the briefing; which I believe to have helped set up the FO to over think the approach. We were initially high as ATC switched from Runway 26 to 8. The FO got back on profile aggressively and in fact got below the profile; but seemed to be in the mindset that he was still behind. We were leveled off at 2200 ft.; our last cleared altitude by ATC. It was a good altitude provided we stayed along the coast. He [was] established on a heading which created a base leg that would allow for us to be wings level at 1000 ft.; but also transitioned 2 NM inland.I noticed this; but elected not to say anything as 1) My technique is not the only one. 2) When I saw that we were below profile and still 12 NM from the field; I challenged him when he asked for gear down. Recognizing that this second point is a sure way for CRM to break down. To complicate matters there was turbulence (the Release had an unusual note 'low level turb on leeward side of terrain...use caution') and while we were below the scattered layer over the terrain a few stray clouds did impede our heading.The terrain from the coast while appearing gentle rises rapidly. I became uncomfortable moments prior to the GPWS warning as the RADIO ALT populated reinforcing that we were too low. The aircraft rolled right (I thought due to turbulence; but upon discussion it was to stay clear of clouds) followed by a GPWS caution which was immediately cut short and a warning ensued. He delayed the escape maneuver rolled away from the terrain. As I called for the escape maneuver the GPWS conflict was resolved.\nWhile on approach to Runway 8 at ITO we had the airfield visual and were subsequently cleared for the visual approach from the southwest. I made a right turn and continued descent to 2100 ft. MSL in order to get below the scattered deck of clouds approximately 4000 ft. MSL. The turn to the east was in order to create a bit more of a base turn in order to create a longer final; however; in doing so I was also flying towards the rising terrain.Upon maneuvering to this base heading; I made a 30-degree banked turn to the southeast to further avoid a cloud. Upon doing so; turned more directly towards the rising terrain. Upon doing so the GPWS activated and alerted us about the terrain; after which I should have performed the terrain escape maneuver but I elected not to do that because we would have very quickly climbed into IMC conditions. So I just reversed the turn direction immediately and the GPWS warning silenced. My base leg; which was approximately 1300 ft. radio altitude; continued the rest of the way to land uneventfully on Runway 8 at ITO.Even though we had talked about the terrain being a factor and all of the GPWS alerts crews had been getting on their way into ITO; we could have planned better and planned for an even shorter base and final in order to make the terrain even less of an issue. If any deviations were needed to be made in order to stay visual; they should have been made away from the terrain not towards it.", {"entities": [[1108, 1118, "WEATHER"], [1239, 1248, "WEATHER"], [1249, 1254, "WEATHER"], [1541, 1551, "WEATHER"], [2037, 2046, "WEATHER"], [7, 12, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [147, 154, "ALTITUDE"], [172, 185, "CREW"], [198, 204, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [299, 301, "ABBREVIATION"], [320, 328, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [356, 359, "CREW"], [394, 396, "ABBREVIATION"], [546, 553, "ALTITUDE"], [585, 588, "CREW"], [699, 707, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [753, 760, "ALTITUDE"], [787, 789, "ABBREVIATION"], [939, 941, "ABBREVIATION"], [1824, 1832, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1863, 1871, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1917, 1932, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1987, 1994, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1998, 2005, "ALTITUDE"], [2007, 2010, "ABBREVIATION"], [2076, 2083, "ALTITUDE"], [2085, 2088, "ABBREVIATION"], [2150, 2154, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2227, 2233, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2286, 2290, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2633, 2640, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2746, 2754, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2780, 2787, "ALTITUDE"], [2789, 2794, "AIRPLANE"], [2838, 2842, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3068, 3072, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["At some point after departure EICAS indicated WINDOW HEAT L FWD and WINDOW HEAT R SIDE. As the Pilot Monitoring; accomplished the irregular checklist which resulted in primary heat being removed from the appropriate windows. Several hours later Captain and I left the cockpit to begin our break. Shortly afterword I was summoned; informed we were diverting to ZZZZ; and returned to the cockpit. I was briefed that upon further investigation it appeared that some 38 circuit breakers had tripped and upon consultation with [Maintenance Control] and Dispatch the decision to divert due to a possible issue with PECS system was made. I concurred with this decision. Also during this time there apparently was an issue with an uncooperative passenger leading to declaring a threat level 1 and law enforcement was requested to meet the aircraft upon arrival. We continued to ZZZZ and landed uneventfully. The entire crew coordination during this event was excellent.\nFirst Officer and myself completed first rest break subsequently receiving a transition briefing on the flight deck from Captain . Our position on the route was in the area of transition to ETOPS entry and Oceanic crossing. With my taking Captain seat on the flight deck and he going on rest break; I reviewed the cockpit discovering a status message: ELEC P300 DISTR CHANNEL and ELEC P100 PANEL. Part of Captain's briefing included an INOP primary L FWD and R SIDE window heat. Curious if the status message was associated with the failure or written up separately in the electronic logbook; I reviewed the electronic log items unable to determine any association or an independent item. Further; First Officer had pulled up the electronic circuit breaker status page to note multiple pages of system discrepancies listed with circuit breaker position 'Unknown'. Unable to research the status message satisfactorily; I called Captain to inquire his knowledge of the situation. He was not familiar with the matter and chose to come up to the cockpit for review; whereby he decided to resume his seat to make a satcom call to [Maintenance Control] with his headset. First Officer and myself continued normal flight duties while listening and commenting as the conversation with [Maintenance Control] continued. The concern from the flight deck were the many critical system circuit breakers in position 'Unknown'; thus possibly affecting normal and/or back up system capabilities. Maintenance Control researched and indicated that the status was dispatchable and deferable for ETOPS. However; with specific review of individual systems queried by Captain; he was not able to ascertain the status of several individual critical systems to include systems like landing gear relays and others. Upon further review; one critical system in particular; the POWER ELECTRONICS COOLING SYSTEM (PECS); the liquid cooling system for the large motor power distribution system in the aft E/E compartment appeared and was stated by [Maintenance Control] to have a pump that was not operable. This was a standout item of concern; among several; to the 3 pilots; [Maintenance Control]; and Dispatch. For me personally having been involved as a ferry crew with [Company's] first PECS replacement involving [Manufacturer] and other lead engineers support; it is a very critical system needing to function properly. I also recalled how some of the MEL script at the time was inaccurate; unsafe; and subscript of how we were ok to continue; dispatch and defer on the ground questionable. With the [oceanic] crossing ahead of us and the status of many of our systems 'Unknown'; the Captain; with multiple sources of input; ultimately made the decision to divert to ZZZZ to address the issue on the ground. The flying First Officer arrived in the cockpit from rest break during the divert and subsequently landed the aircraft. Much of the electrical fault issue was resolved by ZZZZ Maintenance who were familiar and had dealt with the issue on 3 separate occasions. They were successful in resetting much of the faulted channels with the exception of the landing gear specifics. Meanwhile; our pilot crew duty timed out whereby Maintenance continued working to repair. As a side note; luckily with a few hours of work; the repair was complete and a [Company] cargo crew in the EMPTY terminal happened to be available to continue the flight to ZZZ with Status Normal.", {"entities": [[30, 35, "AIRPLANE"], [245, 252, "CREW"], [268, 275, "AIRPLANE"], [386, 393, "AIRPLANE"], [523, 534, "CREW"], [548, 556, "CREW"], [879, 885, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [962, 975, "CREW"], [1083, 1090, "CREW"], [1152, 1157, "ABBREVIATION"], [1201, 1208, "CREW"], [1209, 1213, "AIRPLANE"], [1276, 1283, "AIRPLANE"], [1367, 1374, "CREW"], [1428, 1434, "AIRPLANE"], [1660, 1673, "CREW"], [1889, 1896, "CREW"], [2004, 2011, "AIRPLANE"], [2057, 2061, "AIRPLANE"], [2088, 2099, "CREW"], [2127, 2140, "CREW"], [2240, 2251, "CREW"], [2442, 2453, "CREW"], [2538, 2543, "ABBREVIATION"], [2608, 2615, "CREW"], [2720, 2732, "AIRPLANE"], [2980, 2991, "CREW"], [3100, 3106, "CREW"], [3109, 3120, "CREW"], [3135, 3143, "CREW"], [3622, 3629, "CREW"], [3750, 3756, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3757, 3770, "CREW"], [3771, 3778, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3786, 3793, "AIRPLANE"], [3845, 3851, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3922, 3933, "CREW"], [4095, 4107, "AIRPLANE"], [4134, 4139, "CREW"], [4168, 4179, "CREW"], [4323, 4331, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

	["The objective for this particular flight was recurrent formation training for me; with the assistance of the pilot of a second aircraft (an occasional training partner; based at another nearby airport).  Per our telephonic briefing on the ground; we agreed that we would rendezvous in a particular location and that he would fly lead and I would join off his wing there.  We further agreed on a time; altitude; frequency and call signs.As I approached the practice area I observed at my 12 o'clock position at approximately 3;500 MSL an [Aircraft Y type] heading in the same direction -- i.e. to the center of the practice area.On the air-to-air frequency; I then made my first call to check in and to ask the flight lead if he was in position.

A moment later; the [Aircraft Y type] in front of me began a gentle turn to the left.Once I was established in the turn and began to close; my partner asked for my current position; I indicated that I was moving from trail to his right wing.  During this time I moved into a loose fingertip off the lead aircraft.  About this time my partner asked again for my position and said he could not see me.  I replied that I was off his right wing; and thought for a moment that possibly I was partly blocked by the window/door framing.  To help with his field of view; I moved slightly forward to a more visible bearing line; and then radioed to ask if he had a clear visual.  He responded that he still did not; and at that point it suddenly occurred to me that I might be flying formation off the wrong aircraft.  Over the air-to-air frequency I read the N number of the [Aircraft Y type] in view; and asked if that was my training partner's aircraft (we had been using call signs; so I had not had any prior occasion to reference his N number).

The tower controller indicated that he was not talking with that aircraft but said he would relay the message if the [Aircraft Y type] should check in.That was the end of the mistaken/unsafe condition and the rest of the flight proceeded normally.Contributing factors to this confusion included:1) The remarkable coincidence that the mistaken [Aircraft Y type] was in exactly the right place at the right time and the right altitude; and that it subsequently began a turn exactly when I requested my flight lead to do so2) My failure to ask my training partner to utilize TCAS/ADS-B to firmly establish me on his PFD prior to my moving in on what I thought was the flight lead3) My electing to join from a trail position; which denied my flight lead a chance at a visual until later in the process4) My expectation bias that; because of Corona; there would be few if any other aircraft and that this must have been my training partner (as it happens; the mistaken [Aircraft Y type] and the intended [Aircraft Y type] were the only two aircraft I saw or heard in the sky all day).", {"entities": [[1047, 1052, "WEATHER"], [1228, 1233, "WEATHER"], [109, 114, "CREW"], [325, 328, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [359, 363, "AIRPLANE"], [441, 451, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [530, 533, "ABBREVIATION"], [771, 782, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1011, 1021, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1423, 1427, "AIRPLANE"], [1623, 1627, "AIRPLANE"], [1696, 1702, "AIRPLANE"], [1703, 1707, "AIRPLANE"], [1955, 1961, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2253, 2259, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2424, 2429, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2585, 2590, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3153, 3157, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

The landing was normal and we continued the takeoff as planned. Just after becoming airborne; we noticed a helicopter taking off from the taxiway to our right. I pulled power and leveled flight around 100 ft. The helicopter continued to climb on its heading and crossed from our right wing to our left wing directly above us at what looked like less than 50 ft. separation. After regaining sight of the helicopter off our left wing; I returned to climb configuration. A few seconds later the helicopter appeared to be in a slight bank back to the right into our flight path. I turned slightly to the right and continued climb. A few more seconds passed and the helicopter turned steeply directly at us forcing me to dive right immediately. All of this happened prior to reaching 700 ft. The helicopter passed behind us and left the airspace.While I focused on flying the plane; my instructor handled the radios. Tower responded that the helicopter was to remain west of the field. At this point the helicopter pilot called in saying he had us in sight from the beginning. I do not believe this is possible. I had to drastically change course three times in the span of about 40 seconds to prevent a collision. Two of these maneuvers I would consider highly inappropriate at such low altitudes; at night; in a densely populated area if it had not been for the [urgent] situation the helicopter pilot put us in.At the conclusion of my flight; I called the Tower phone number to clarify what happened. The Controller told me that the helicopter had been cleared for a 'coded departure' from a taxiway. This departure path was supposed to takeoff to the southwest and keep the aircraft west of the field. Due to winds at the time; the pilot decided to takeoff to the northeast instead. It is unclear whether this was communicated to Tower. I believe this miscommunication between Tower and the other pilot led to our initial near miss.

While I may feel fine personally allowing customers to sit in one additional row; and another FA two rows; some FAs may not feel comfortable allowing any leeway unless they had to.We had to redirect many customers back FWD because the Operations Agent refused to make a PA about the restrictions prior to boarding and the customers don't always pay attention to our PAs onboard.There were (understandably) a few frustrated customers; but we tried to explain the reasoning. We feel like there should be a bit more definition. It's very complicated when we don't have assigned seating and people just sit where their boarding pass tells them. If we block 6 rows total; that means we can't have more than X number of passengers on this type of aircraft (leaving an open middle seat between them); and with middle seats filled that brings us to a maximum of X number of passengers while still keeping our 6 rows.Can we possibly get some guidance on how to best handle this? I was trying to be consistent for every other FA's sake; so that customers understand what's expected. While I wouldn't tell a customer this; they have a choice in flying...and their travel should be limited to essential only.

	["Aircraft X checked on to my frequency. I asked the pilot to advise when they had automated weather at GJT airport and what approach they were requesting. They advised they were requesting the RNAV 29 approach to GJT starting over the waypoint CESBA. Aircraft X was tracking from the Southeast to the Northwest. With giving them direct to CESBA; they must be vectored out as they get closer to the IAF due to the requirements of no more than a 90 degree turn. I advised the pilot to expect vectors to get set up for the approach; and also advised them that I could only cross them at CESBA at 12000 feet due to the terrain. The approach shows them crossing CESBA at or above 8500 feet. The pilot responded with 'Ok'. As Aircraft X got closer to the airport; I had them vectored 10 degrees left for the approach; and descending to 13000 feet. As they cleared the higher terrain; I descended them to 12000 feet; and watched to make sure that when given the approach clearance to CESBA they would stay clear of higher terrain. When I gave the approach clearance direct to CESBA; maintain 12000 feet until CESBA cleared RNAV 29 GJT; they read it back except for the 'maintain 12000 until CESBA' which I missed in the readback. As I watched Aircraft X track towards CESBA I noticed that their altitude dropped below 12000 feet. At 11;200 feet I issued a low altitude alert; and to maintain 12000 feet until CESBA. Aircraft X rogered the low altitude alert and continued the descent before beginning a climb back up. They then asked me to clarify if they were cleared for the approach or not. It was my fault that I missed the readback; but the issue with the approaches for Runway 29 is that their IAF start in much higher terrain; causing a very steep descent profile for the pilots. We try to have the conversation with the pilots about this instead of denying the procedure. I have witnessed aircraft go missed approach on the RNAV 29 approach because they claimed they were unable to descend properly; even though the discussion was had with the pilots. I would recommend that this information be forwarded to the airlines to advise their pilots if at all possible; to not utilize RNAV 29 or LDA 29 approaches due to having to be vectored out and starting the approach at higher altitudes; not allowing for a stabilized approach/descent.

	["I am submitting this report to address two things - 1) My crew accepting a takeoff clearance; when ATC called us by the wrong callsign; and 2) A general lack of alertness that I am seeing on the line as a result of these extremely irregular times.Regarding the takeoff clearance - we were Number 1 at the hold short for runway at ZZZ. We were the only aircraft out there. Nobody else in line or even within 300 yards of the runway. ATC issued a takeoff clearance for runway and the callsign was very similar to ours. My FO accepted the clearance (reading back the correct callsign) and off we went. In retrospect I believe that ATC referred to us as Company XXX (not YXX). This became clear to me when he said it again and corrected himself while switching us to departure. In truth there was no doubt in my mind that the clearance was intended for us because we were literally the only ones there; but I still should have clarified it. The takeoff was uneventful. I believe that a factor in this event is the fact that all of us are becoming a little too complacent with [few] people on each flight and virtually no other traffic around us. Every flight is starting to feel like that delayed 2 AM departure where the usual tension of flying aircraft tends to go away with direct clearances that never happen and comms that are a bit too relaxed.  We are letting our guard down at a time where we can ill afford it.I should have stopped and asked the Controller to clarify. Even though I was 100% sure that the clearance was intended for us; I let my guard down. Verify that clearance was for Company YXX. He says oops sorry; we read it back; and off we go. If we weren't the only ones there or the field was more complicated or congested that could have bitten us. As a group we need to re-dedicate ourselves to being careful and methodical in our flying. Our airline and our industry are already hanging on by a thread.  I can't imagine a worse time to add an accident to the mix.

	["We encountered an electrical problem [during our flight]. A normal approach and landing was made. There was no damage to the aircraft. I was the Captain.It was night. We were descending through approximately 15;000 ft. and were about 35 NM northwest of the airport; and in the middle of a turn to a new course; when the electrical problem occurred. We had been cleared down to 10;000 ft. The First Officer was flying when the autopilot and autothrottles kicked off; the First Officer's FMC turned off; and many unrelated things on the First Officer's side turned off. There were many; many EICAS messages. It was very confusing.There was no previous indication of potential electrical problems. We were not in a phase of flight; such as the approach; where any electrical switching would take place. The problem did not happen with the movement of any switch or button. It just happened out of the blue. There were no yaw or pitch motions; so there didn't appear to be an aerodynamic issue. All the Captain's screens and instruments appeared normal and I could see the FMC course on my left ND; so I took control of the airplane and finished the turn. At this point I was not thinking about the problem as much as keeping the airplane on course and on altitude. There was a cloud deck below us at around 12;500-13;000 ft. We quickly determined to get ATC into the picture; get permission to level off at 13;000 ft.; get radar vectors and work the problem. ATC helped us as requested; and there were no problems there. The First Officer was right in there with suggestions and with getting our situational awareness to a good level; both with the airplane status and with our flying status. He suggested starting the APU immediately; which we did.I flew while the First Officer worked through the QRH; since I had the only untarnished instrument setup. I slowed down; and our fuel state was ok. It took us a bit of conferencing to determine what the main problem was and what we should work first. We determined that the right AC was depowered; the right generator was tripped; and the right bus tie ISOL light was on. We worked that problem first.The QRH had us reset the right generator. That worked fine and the right generator remained on the line with no problems. That problem was fixed; the right AC bus was powered; and a whole bunch of EICAS messages went away. After a Recall/Review we only had the right bus tie ISOL light/EICAS illuminated and the both Utility buses were off.Next we went into getting the Utility buses reset. The right one didn't reset; so we stopped there. We were in a freighter. We had both main busses powered; got the autopilot and autothrottles back; and the right FMC. I elected to have us fly and land the aircraft in this configuration; and the First Officer concurred. I gave the aircraft back to the First Officer for him to make the landing. We redid the descent flow; and everything was working and set as before; except the autobrakes had to be reset to the 3 setting. The autobrakes held the 3 setting. A recheck of the MCP settings found that none had changed.The field was VFR under an overcast; so I saw no reason to go elsewhere. It was a long runway; and there was maintenance there.

Captain replied he had 60 kts. After a quick cross check by both of us; we determined we did have an actual airspeed miscompare of 20-25 kts. Captain aborted takeoff. I called Tower and informed them of abort and they directed us to an appropriate taxiway. Upon exit; I did my after landing flow; noted brake temps; and we discussed the situation. Returned to gate and Captain made the appropriate logbook entry and contacted Maintenance.After gate return; a mechanic showed me he had identified the cause of our problem.

During this time we kept Tower apprised of our status. Maintenance arrived. We shutdown an engine to allow for inspection of the tire. They inspected the tire and determined we required a tow. Tower was informed and we were towed to our parking spot.\nWe had landed on and cleared the runway on a hi-speed exit. Taxi instructions were to taxi to our parking. The turn from one taxiway to the other is a turn of about 120 degrees. As I was looking left to clear the left hand turn I did not see any other taxi lights or any other reason to not extend the aircraft path to make the turn; so I over-steered the turn so as to not drag my left main gear through the taxi lights or off of the taxiway surface. I had slowed to approximately 25 knots to exit the runway at the hi speed turnoff and began executing the turn to the taxiway at approximately 10 knots. I had the 10-9 airport page up in the night mode with the brightness turned down because of operating at night; with aircraft tracking on to aid in the taxi. As I was in the turn I heard a 'bang' followed by the tire failure aural warning. I stopped the aircraft and notified Tower of the failed tire. We coordinated to have Maintenance come out and verify the tire failure and after confirming the tire was 'shredded' we were towed into the gate.As I cleared the runway I saw that it was a turn of about 120 degrees so I planned to extend the aircraft path to over-steer onto the taxiway and not have my left main gear depart the taxiway surface. As I was clearing the left hand turn I did not see any taxiway lighting; or any other reason not to make the turn as planned. The Airport page depicts an 'island' dividing the left and right taxi lanes. This island is a darker shade than all the other taxiway demarcations; which in the night mode with the brightness turned down is almost invisible; and easily missed. This 'island' is also paved and indistinguishable from the taxiway. I was informed that I had taxied over a light on a taxiway which is what actually caused the tire failure.As I did not see any taxiway lighting; I am unsure where the taxiway lighting is located; but having the area better lighted with either lights or reflectors would help. The island that is depicted on the Airport page is actually a darker shaded area than the other areas depicting the taxiways; and in the night mode with the brightness turned down is easily missed; these areas should be highlighted more; or a note to exit the runway at taxiways that do not require turns of 120 degrees.

	["Was scheduled to deadhead back to ZZZ from ZZZ1 after an overnight and deadhead from ZZZ2. I checked the load on the aircraft that morning and the aircraft was overbooked by X people it was an X type aircraft for XXX passengers.  Several messages of maintaining social distancing were played throughout the airport as well as physical signs about maintaining at least 6 feet between you and other people.  We had several announcements on the aircraft from ZZZ2 about spreading out and maintaining social distancing recommendations.  Yet here we were scheduled on an aircraft where every seat was filled.  I notified crew scheduling about the situation (they should have already known).  I had found an aircraft going directly back to my home (ZZZ3) which was less than half full and asked to be released.  I did notify my crew about the situation and told them what I was planning.  However; the FO lives in ZZZ and had no other options; the FAs did not think they could get released and thought that they had no other options.  With no N95 masks to protect themselves and with studies showing that over 50% of infected individuals are asymptomatic the company put their crews in a no win situation with the high possibility to be infected and unable to perform their duties within 2-14 days as well as possibly infecting other crews within that time not to mention their families.Crew scheduling has the same software and better than crews do to check aircraft loads.  Our partners know what their aircraft loads are.  Just two weeks ago a similar situation presented itself and our partner replaced the same type aircraft with a much larger aircraft] in order to enable social distancing and passenger comfort as well as crew safety.  We have multiple aircraft sitting unused and deteriorating on the runways and taxiways of all of our hubs.  There is no excuse for allowing this situation.  We were a valid and available crew; aircraft need to fly in order to avoid future maintenance issues and there are aircraft not being used.  At a minimum someone should set up some crew only flights for transporting commuting and deadheading crews; so we can reduce our exposure. They could be shared between all airline companies.  At the same time or in addition more aircraft should be utilized as passengers should not be forced to sit next to each other and violate CDC guidelines.  Our partners could start enabling us to fly; but instead had canceled several flights (not for crew availability or aircraft) during the day.

	["The [ ] Police Department requested assistance in locating a missing autistic teenager that had been missing for about three hours. It was reported the missing child with diminished intelligence was barefoot and without a coat. Sources felt the male teenager would likely find a spot and hide. The outside air temperature at the time of the search was about 55 degrees Fahrenheit. The subject was last seen around the neighborhood pool complex; which was located a couple of blocks away from the child's residence. The neighborhood was a tight network of townhomes. I decided the better landing zone (LZ) would be in the pool complex parking lot or on the wider open street next to it. After relocating and establishing the LZ; I readied the aircraft for flight. The top and bottoms strobes were turned on; blades attached; and the aircraft was powered up. There were no error messages except for an SD card error on the visual camera. Since it was night; there was going to be little need for the visual camera. I determined to launch with that error. The thermal camera was set for White Hot ISO with isotherms turned on for people search. The thermal and visual cameras operated normally. I went to approximately 240 feet AGL and made a 360 degree turn with the thermal camera at 0 degrees to see if any obstructions could be identified. None were identified; so I selected that as my search altitude. I began a loose grid search with [ ] looking over my shoulder at the screen to assist in spotting possible targets. The normal targets alerted; including sewer covers; electric transformers; street lights; and many heat pumps located behind homes. [ ] went to examine the back of one row of townhomes that had a different target. He reported back it was more HVAC units generating heat signatures. When the first battery was down to 20% flight time; I began to head back to the LZ to change batteries. [ ] changed the batteries to another fully charged TB55 set. I launched again and went to an altitude of 240 feet AGL and began a grid search across the area. There were times towards the edge of the grid search where I lost sight of the aircraft; but I continued the search because this was a missing disadvantaged child. Since there were no people spotted below; I felt the risk to people on the ground was minimal. I accepted the risk for the flight and continued. Approximately six minutes into the second flight; the aircraft showed about 18 minutes of flight time remaining. I observed I had lost control of the thermal camera gimbal and could not move it from a 55 degree down angle.  I was at the furthermost most point on one of the grid arms and hovering over a possible target I was going to have visually examined. I felt that the target may have been a street light with the head of the light under or in the trees but it may have also been a person sitting under a tree. Without warning the aircraft gave me a battery voltage error and a statement it was landing immediately. I was unable to keep the aircraft in the air; and the most I could do was guide the aircraft to a Final Termination Point (FTP) and get the aircraft to the ground without injuring anyone. Without the ability to move the thermal camera; I was left with few options. I could see what might have been an open field in front of me with some trees nearby. There was what appeared to be one of the primary streets into the neighborhood in front of me; but I had no idea of any traffic approaching on that road or trees below me. I turned to the left and spotted one of the townhome parking lots that was a dead end. I attempted to keep the aircraft in the air to look for any other FTPs; but the aircraft continued descending; and I received a message that it only had seconds of flight time remaining. I decided to put the aircraft down in the townhome parking area and began directionally controlling the aircraft during an uncontrolled descent to what I felt was a safe landing area considering I had no camera gimbal control.

Upon rolling out of a left turn I noticed a close shadow on the ground; for which we continued to turn left while the other aircraft properly also turned left to avoid.

	["This pairing was built as a deadhead out in Aircraft X with us flying the same aircraft back.

He told the gate agent that company was not complying with promises made on their booking. 'I booked this seat and it showed no occupant here;' he pointed at well-masked young man in [the seat]. 'I can't have this man in this seat.' The C/S agent explained that the booking said 'If available' and that we had to accommodate additional passengers.' C/S agent said; 'You are welcome to de-plane and I'll book you on another flight.' He said; 'I'm staying; I have a connection in ZZZ.'

He said pointing to his mask; 'This covers better than the N-95; so no thanks; I don't need that.' He apologized to the FA Purser and ensured he be calm going forward. The Purser could have said; 'Okay; thank you;' but of course; she didn't. She said loudly that; (paraphrase) 'What you did is unacceptable; and if you repeat that behavior in any way; there will be security to meet you at the gate.' The passenger nodded and said simply; (paraphrase) 'I'm scared; I wasn't supposed to have a person next to me.'

	["Preparing to taxi to Runway 01 at SGU; an uncontrolled airport; I as pilot monitoring began monitoring the CTAF frequency. Hearing nothing upon completing our final taxi check; I made a radio call on the correct frequency indicating our position and type of aircraft and that we would be taxing for takeoff on Runway 01 via A. The wind was reported as calm. Hearing no one else on the CTAF; we began our taxi as briefed and broadcast. I placed the CTAF frequency as active in the number 2 radio and selected the Captain to hear and respond to that frequency. Meanwhile; I selected ARTCC as the active in number 1 radio; selected 2 in standby so I could also hear CTAF; and then picked up the clearance.Since we heard no one else on frequency; I advised ATC that we were ready for departure on Runway 01. We were released for departure. Upon coming back to frequency; I switched radio number 1 back to CTAF and ensured both pilots were listening and tuned for that frequency. After completing the final checklist; I made another CTAF announcement that we were; 'taking Runway 01 for departure; climbing to 13;000 via the SID.' Hearing nothing in response; we proceeded onto the runway; and as we aligned with centerline; the Captain stated that he saw an aircraft rotating on the same pavement; opposite direction on Runway 19. I made no less than four immediate queries to the Cessna aircraft as he flew overhead. I asked if he was on CTAF; if his radio was broken; and also to identify himself via callsign. There was no reply until he was out of sight. Having turned crosswind; he made a position announcement. I then queried him again as before but he simply replied that there was another aircraft waiting to takeoff on Runway 19 and that he was exiting the pattern to the east.  Immediately; the other aircraft spoke on CTAF and said that he was holding short of the runway still and that it was clear. We then departed without further incident.The cause of this event is the lack of communication from general aviation pilots at a non-towered uncontrolled airport.  I made several checks that our CTAF frequency was in fact correct and that the volumes were turned up. Runway 01/19 at SGU is 9300 feet long and due to the crown and general slope of the pavement; small light colored aircraft are extremely difficult to see at that distance. In fact; the Cessna did not even become visible until rotation whereby his undercarriage contrasted sufficiently with the runway in order to be seen. SGU is known to be hazardous due to the volume of general aviation traffic mixed with turbojet aircraft. The lack of situational awareness and cavalier radio attitude shown in this instance is at best alarming and at worst recklessly negligent. A contributing factor may have been that since we heard no other traffic on frequency; we made the assumption that we were in fact alone at the airport and did not adequately clear the far end; however as aforementioned; small aircraft are near impossible to see against the mountainous horizon at that distance.SGU is well-known by part 121 pilots who frequent it; as an extremely hazardous airport due to the lack of any ATC controlling presence including radar. The airport has significant traffic volume that it is not atypical to have as many as four or five aircraft in the traffic pattern at one time. This is busy for any general aviation airport but the introduction of turbojet traffic makes for increasing hazards. As a personal note; I have never without exaggeration spoken to a fellow 121 pilot about SGU who hasn't agreed that the field should be towered and controlled at least on a limited basis.

	["I was flying a glider today and launched from ZZZ. ZZZ is located under the outer shelf of the ZZZ1 Class B airspace. I am well aware of this airspace as a regular pilot at ZZZ (glider and SEL airplanes typically) and have been based here for 10+ years. Today I was attempting to climb in the glider (using thermals / rising air currents and no engine or other power source) to almost the base of the Class B [3500 feet MSL) and then use the altitude to cruise NW out of the Bravo lateral boundaries before climbing higher. I rely on my installed electric/gps-based glide computer to help me avoid the Bravo lateral confines as it has a very accurate moving map display and provides audible 'airspace warning' alerts. I had made a few climbs and stopped by 3400 feet MSL to avoid the 3500 feet Bravo base and headed west. My flight computer showed me outside of the Bravo lateral limits so I continued a climb at some point. As I was passing 4000 or 4100 feet while climbing in circles (thermalling) I noticed that the map on my glide computer was not moving like it usually does when I circle. (As I try to keep my eyes outside for traffic; I listen to my 'audio variometer' to judge my climb speed and the glide computer gives verbal airspace alerts when I approach the Bravo or other airspace usually. So I do not glance inside the cockpit at the glide computer very often when thermalling/climbing.) I checked the status screen on the flight computer and realized it had no GPS location lock. I knew I was close to the edge of the Bravo from visual references but I thought I was still NW of the lateral boundary. I opened my 'backup' flight computer on my iPhone which uses the iPhone built-in GPS and realized I was inside the outer shelf of the Bravo at about 4000 MSL. Oh no! I immediately turned west and made a direct run out of the Bravo as soon as I realized this. I continued my flight relying on my backup (iPhone) glide computer and never did get a GPS signal on my primary installed glide computer for the rest of this flight. When I landed; I opened the back of the instrument panel and discovered my problem - the GPS antenna wire had vibrated loose and fallen out of the port in the glide computer. I plugged it back in; screwed it tight and tested the glide computer to determine that I now had a working GPS signal. Unfortunately this event occurred because of my over-reliance on the installed GPS technology to keep me out of the Bravo airspace instead of good old fashioned pilotage using landmarks. Contributing to this was the fact that the glide computer does not provide any sort of 'GPS Lost' alert (audible or visual) and the fact that I was concentrating on circling/climbing and not glancing at the computer very often; which I should have done since I knew I was near the Bravo and there was a westerly wind aloft [5-7 knots) that was likely blowing me towards the Bravo as I circled. Finally; I could have also had my backup iPhone computer/position alerts working as a double-check while I was close to the Bravo airspace. In the future; I will glance at the installed map once every circle when climbing or operating near controlled airspace to make sure I have a valid GPS signal. I will also have my backup iPhone computer activated during flight near/under Bravo airspace as a double check. Finally; I will rely more on landmarks to make sure I remain clear of the airspace whenever near the vertical limits of it.", {"entities": [[2836, 2840, "WEATHER"], [6, 12, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [164, 169, "CREW"], [280, 285, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [345, 351, "AIRPLANE"], [389, 393, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [410, 419, "ALTITUDE"], [420, 423, "ABBREVIATION"], [454, 460, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [507, 515, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [735, 741, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [757, 766, "ALTITUDE"], [767, 770, "ABBREVIATION"], [784, 793, "ALTITUDE"], [800, 804, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [904, 909, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [950, 959, "ALTITUDE"], [966, 974, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1188, 1193, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1259, 1267, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1335, 1342, "AIRPLANE"], [1478, 1481, "AIRPLANE"], [1699, 1702, "AIRPLANE"], [1772, 1775, "ABBREVIATION"], [1964, 1967, "AIRPLANE"], [2050, 2056, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2132, 2135, "AIRPLANE"], [2136, 2143, "AIRPLANE"], [2325, 2328, "AIRPLANE"], [2416, 2419, "AIRPLANE"], [2612, 2615, "AIRPLANE"], [3131, 3139, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3206, 3209, "AIRPLANE"]]}],

	["Before takeoff at JFK I requested a clearance along the Skyline Route northbound after departure. I was cleared for a downwind departure. After flying an extended downwind I asked if Tower wanted me to continue to fly further on the same course. Tower instructed me to follow the 'South Shore Route' or something that sounded like that. I could not find any 'Shore' Route on the VFR charts; including the NY TAC; the Hudson SFRA chart; or the Skyline Route chart. To clarify; I told Tower that I would follow the coastline. Tower asked me to maintain at or below 1;400 feet; which would soon put me outside the 8 mile. Class B ring from JFK; and under a 1;500 foot Class B shelf.While I was satisfied that JFK wanted me to follow the coast; I continued looking through charts to find a 'Shore' or 'Shoreline' Route in case it included any special routing; but I didn't find it. During that time; JFK Tower switched me over to EWR Tower; and at around that point I realized that I had drifted up to almost 1;600 MSL while looking through charts; and I corrected my altitude immediately. I still had my unique squawk code and believed I still had a Class B clearance; but since JFK Tower had asked me to maintain 1;400 feet; I wasn't sure whether they intended that I exit Class B and get a new clearance back in. Once I spoke to EWR Tower and made my request to transition the Skyline Route; EWR Tower cleared me into Class B again; so it became further unclear to me whether I had retained my Class B clearance after leaving the 8 mile Class B ring from JFK; and whether that meant that I had reentered Class B without authorization. I think that I still had a clearance; however; because Tower knew my intentions to continue along the Skyline Route; which is in Class B; and they had kept me on my squawk code.After the flight; I found that there is a South Shore route published on the NY Helicopter Chart; which I wouldn't have had with me in an airplane and wouldn't have consulted as part of my preflight briefing. During the flight; I had judged that my clarifying read back that I would follow the coastline was sufficiently clear to confirm my understanding. But I ended up hunting through charts in complex part of the airspace that I'm not very familiar with to be double certain; and that caused me to get distracted enough to climb almost 200 feet above my assigned altitude and back into Class B (if JFK meant to cancel my class B clearance one I departed the 8 mi. ring).In hindsight; I could have told JFK Tower that I was unfamiliar with the South Shore Route instead of just confirming that I would follow the coastline. This could have prompted JFK Tower to Issue a clearance in different words; which may have avoided my searching around in my charts for 'Shore' route. After all; searching for the route and flipping through charts is what caused my distraction that resulted in my climb.Additionally; I realized later that various Towers around NYC have referred to locations that are charted on helicopter charts; but not on the charts intended for airplane pilots. The South Shore Route is one example. Another example is LGA Tower clearing me over the Throgs Neck Bridge (I know this bridge because I live locally; but I see that it's charted on the Helicopter Chart; but not on the other VFR charts). There seem to be several visual checkpoints (and routes) that are used by New York ATC in communicating with airplanes that may be are only charted for helicopters; or perhaps are only known by locals. While this may be common practice in less complex Class D airspace; it would be beneficial to survey NYC area towers (and other towers in complex airspace) to identify visual checkpoints and routes assigned to VFR airplanes that may be lacking at least on terminal charts or appropriate supplements. The purpose would be to avoid distraction and confusion and to reduce radio transmissions and potential deviations for airplanes transitioning VFR. Airplanepilots would also be able to familiarize themselves with these heretofore uncharted visual checkpoints pursuant to 91.103.One more thought is that there may be confusion in the pilot population about when a Class B clearance ends. I tried to look this up and asked two other CFIs; and I got differing opinions; but the majority agreed that I had retained my Class B clearance because I remained on the squawk code and because JFK Tower had my request to transition still inside Class B; regardless of whether EWR Tower told me again that I was cleared to enter Class B.

	["We were cruising at 11500; southbound; and planning on overflying ZZZ to continue toward ZZZ1 for a training flight. We were over the mountainous area when I noticed the engine losing 200 rpm from the cruise RPM of 2400. I immediately enrichen the mixture and pulled carb heat. Oil pressure and oil temp were in the green. My safety pilot squawked 7700 and declare over CTAF. Multiple planes on CTAF were offering assistance and advice regarding ZZZ and the area surrounding it. I'm familiar with the area and just flown that same route yesterday so I know that we cannot make it to ZZZ from where we were at and there is no other airport insight. I noticed that ZZZ2 is listed at a private airport off of my 10 o'clock but I'm not familiar with that airport and foreflight doesn't give me the information needed quickly enough. We were preparing to land on a field somewhere in city; state as the engine performance deteriorates to the point where there is barely enough to keep us afloat at 80 mph. After troubleshooting the engine; messing around with the mixture and power setting; I was able to find the sweet spot where the engine runs smoothly and no longer vibrating but full power wasn't restored; we can now pick up some speed but not quite enough to climb back up to 11500 from 10000. We were still continuing southbound toward ZZZ at around 10000; the engine did sputter really badly at one point but it felt like we got full power back shortly after the rough sputter. Another plane got on CTAF and ask about the 7700 aircraft; I identified ourselves and stated our intention of going for ZZZ. We were told to squawk VFR as Center cannot offer us any help from that side of the mountain. I complied and squawked VFR. We got over ZZZ and I elected to circle the airport roughly 1 mile to the south off of the right base for runway XX as there was a glider being tow and a tow plane taxing on the runway at ZZZ. While circling; I started to play around with the mixture/power setting to ensure that we actually have full power back and the engine will not die on us as we descent down to land at ZZZ. ZZZ downwind for both XX and XY have rising terrain on both side; my main concern was that the engine dies and we have nowhere to glide to. We did contemplate turning back north toward our home airport as the terrain is much more forgiving at ZZZ3 but ultimately decided that flying back north would add way too many unnecessary risks. I started a slow spiraling descent with some power to make sure that the engine will not die. Clear the engine every 1000 ft of altitude that we lose. We were also able to communicate with the glider and the tow plane and they both cleared the runway for us. I entered the right base for XX and landed the plane. The local mechanic after looking over the engine and listen to how the engine act in the air; he stated that it was probably carb ice; which is surprising considering the OAT was 10C; we weren't in moisture and I didn't see an AIRMET Zulu. The biggest factor on us squawking 7700 and declaring mayday so quickly is that we were over some quite rugged terrain and the power loss was quite drastic. We were around 4000 ft AGL; possibly 5000 ft AGL at city and not within gliding range of ZZZ. This is also my first inflight emergency where my engine stops producing power. We both learned about carb icing in school but never experience it in real life. Knowing what we know now. Squawking 7700 and declaring mayday right away might have been a bit premature; we should have to spend a couple of minutes to troubleshoot the problem first as the engine was producing power; oil pressure/oil temp were good. My safety pilot was also not too familiar with the plane and he didn't know what the plane is truly capable of as far as gliding distance goes. His main concern was to put the plane down in a field; he was afraid that we would crash into a mountain trying to make it to [another city]. When we were over ZZZ; he wanted us to descent as quickly as possible and land at ZZZ without troubleshooting the engine first; which is what I was doing. I wasn't comfortable with descending when I know the engine is running fine up here and the overly sensitive mixture setting could possibly contribute to the reason why the engine almost died on us. I didn't want to descent into denser air that could possibly mess with the mixture and kill the engine. We were having a little conflict in the cockpit in the middle of an emergency on what we should do. [Another city] not having weather reporting capability along with the glider being towed on the runway while not monitoring CTAF also added additional stress to our situation. This in-flight emergency highlighted the importance of who's doing what during an emergency; those conversation needs to happen on the ground; not in the middle of an emergency.", {"entities": [[282, 290, "WEATHER"], [2959, 2967, "WEATHER"], [3359, 3364, "WEATHER"], [3636, 3644, "WEATHER"], [4535, 4542, "WEATHER"], [170, 176, "AIRPLANE"], [188, 191, "ABBREVIATION"], [201, 207, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [333, 338, "CREW"], [515, 520, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [850, 854, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [898, 904, "AIRPLANE"], [1027, 1033, "AIRPLANE"], [1130, 1136, "AIRPLANE"], [1261, 1266, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1364, 1370, "AIRPLANE"], [1630, 1633, "ABBREVIATION"], [1725, 1728, "ABBREVIATION"], [1827, 1831, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1836, 1842, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1908, 1914, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2051, 2057, "AIRPLANE"], [2099, 2103, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2116, 2124, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2207, 2213, "AIRPLANE"], [2388, 2394, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2475, 2482, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2521, 2527, "AIRPLANE"], [2552, 2558, "AIRPLANE"], [2565, 2572, "ALTITUDE"], [2692, 2698, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2727, 2731, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2743, 2749, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2803, 2809, "AIRPLANE"], [2832, 2838, "AIRPLANE"], [2932, 2935, "ABBREVIATION"], [2988, 2994, "ABBREVIATION"], [2995, 2999, "ABBREVIATION"], [3173, 3180, "ALTITUDE"], [3181, 3184, "ABBREVIATION"], [3195, 3202, "ALTITUDE"], [3203, 3206, "ABBREVIATION"], [3302, 3308, "AIRPLANE"], [3604, 3610, "AIRPLANE"], [3675, 3680, "CREW"], [4025, 4029, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4065, 4071, "AIRPLANE"], [4132, 4142, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4159, 4165, "AIRPLANE"], [4279, 4285, "AIRPLANE"], [4401, 4407, "AIRPLANE"], [4449, 4456, "AIRPLANE"], [4605, 4611, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

I completely missed that Aircraft X was IFR and when they checked in; I told them to advise the weather and maintain VFR at or above 045; due to all the other traffic; I gave him traffic calls and various assignments for VFR altitudes; all of which the pilot read back as VFR instructions. Normally; this aircraft operates VFR; especially when conditions are very good VFR; and I don't know if there was datablock overlap; but I did not realize that he was IFR until I turned him onto the final approach course; I normally give radar vectors for approaches to these flight school aircraft for practice approaches. When I moved the datablock; I realized it was IFR and I apologized to the pilot after asking whether he was IFR (since he answered all my VFR instructions); and I later found out that when he passed by the only IFR aircraft I was working (Aircraft Y) that they were separated by 2.92. I feel badly that I missed the datablock; although I also feel that I was working very hard with high complexity and I ended up terminating flight following to a few aircraft due to the number of aircraft on frequency and in the airspace. I feel like the situation was controlled and I just missed that his datablock was IFR because I had so many aircraft on frequency and in the airspace.I would just normally have had a handoff or extra set of eyes watching me if I was working this amount of traffic at this sector; but due to our staffing situation with COVID-19; we have just a few controllers per shift.", {"entities": [[626, 633, "WEATHER"], [430, 433, "ABBREVIATION"], [499, 502, "ABBREVIATION"], [570, 573, "ABBREVIATION"], [647, 650, "ABBREVIATION"], [751, 754, "ABBREVIATION"], [783, 788, "CREW"], [802, 805, "ABBREVIATION"], [853, 856, "ABBREVIATION"], [899, 902, "ABBREVIATION"], [987, 990, "ABBREVIATION"], [1019, 1033, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1076, 1086, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1132, 1142, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1190, 1193, "ABBREVIATION"], [1218, 1223, "CREW"], [1252, 1255, "ABBREVIATION"], [1282, 1285, "ABBREVIATION"], [1355, 1358, "ABBREVIATION"], [1750, 1753, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],
	["I received a handoff on Aircraft X. I immediately recognized the aircraft was too low for my terrain. I pulled up my MIA (Minimum IFR Altitude) map; ran a route line; and verified the aircraft would need to be at 14;000 ft. to be above MIA. When Aircraft X checked on; I immediately asked the aircraft if they were capable of 14;000 ft.; or if they would prefer a vector to south to stay in lower MIA. The pilot of Aircraft X responded 'Yeah; 14;000 ft. is no problem!'. I told the aircraft to expect higher in 10 minutes; and the pilot of Aircraft X read back 'expecting 14;000 ft. in 10 minutes.' I had made the decision to climb the aircraft near a VOR which was about 3 to 4 minutes flying time from the higher MIA. I checked the aircraft climbing characteristics on ERIDS; which showed the aircraft was capable of 900 ft. per minute. As the aircraft would only need to climb 1;000 ft.; I felt comfortable giving the climb later which was roughly 10 minutes from his current position.I gave the instruction to climb to 14;000 ft. The pilot of Aircraft X read it back correctly. The plane did not climb immediately. It took much longer than I expected for the aircraft to begin climbing; especially given that the pilot was expecting a climb. Once the aircraft began climbing; I noticed the aircraft was only doing about 100 ft. per update. The aircraft went a few updates without climbing at all. At this point; the aircraft was within the 13;900 ft. terrain bubble. Knowing that the peak in that terrain bubble is near the center; I decided that as a safety measure I would turn the aircraft away from the center as he continued his climb. I gave the aircraft 10 degrees right; which the pilot followed. Once the aircraft showed level at 14;000 ft. and MSAW (Minimum Safe Altitude Warning) alert was done; I cleared the aircraft back on his route.I could have provided the pilot with an earlier climb. I held off giving the pilot an early climb due to the confidence in his answers. I didn't think climbing to 14;000 ft. would take as long as it did. If I gave a clearance to climb earlier; the issue wouldn't have occurred. The aircraft was on the south edge of a 13;900 ft. terrain bubble.

Should an explosive decompression occur; time of useful consciousness at typical flight levels is approximately 15-30 seconds. Time is critical. Modern airliners utilize quick-don pilot oxygen masks for a reason. Has the FAA conducted extensive testing verifying face masks will not interfere with oxygen mask use? If not; face masks must be removed before oxygen mask use. A process that will take critical time at a critical time. Should the face mask be pulled down below the chin or should it be remove above the head? How will a tied face mask be quickly untied?  Pilots have received zero training in these tasks. These questions pose serious risks until they are analyzed.Because of the extreme risks to flight safety should oxygen masks be immediately required; the FAA must immediately intervene and prohibit face mask use during flight until they have specifically tested various face mask types and determine which; if any; are safe for use in flight.", {"entities": [[526, 531, "CREW"], [567, 570, "ABBREVIATION"], [1120, 1123, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],
	["Inbound on the TYSSN5 arrival.  Just past KADDY we were cleared direct LARRE and descend to 7;000.  I selected level change with 7;000 feet in the FCP (Flight Control Panel) window.  Passing 8;000 feet at 230 kts IAS I realized this new vector and descent would possibly bring us in below the Class B airspace.  I immediately selected 200 knots in the FCP window and used speed brakes to slow.  We reached 200 kts at approximately 7;300 feet MSL.  Upon further review of the Low IFR chart it was apparent that the Class B floor was at 8;000 feet during this deceleration.After being vectored off the arrival and given a descent; low situational awareness resulted in a late analysis of our position relative to the Class B floor.  Selection of level change was the wrong choice given our relative distance from LARRE; V/S with a reduced rate of descent would have slowed down the timeline.  This would have provided me more time to react with the deceleration and possibly kept us above 8;000 feet until passing 23 DME.  Environmental factors that may have been involved were time of day/direction of flight which resulted in us flying directly into the sun.I believe if the Class B airspace were depicted on our arrival charts it would greatly enhance situational awareness.  Currently we have to switch between the arrival or approach plate and the Low IFR chart to find our position relative to the Class B airspace.  In the scenario I've described this switching back and forth between charts often occurs at a high workload point on the arrival.  Reducing our rate of descent; slowing sooner; and having a better working knowledge of the Class B boundaries would have all been helpful.

I quickly noticed that the number 2 engine N1 had not reached the target N1 but the number 1 engine was already at its requested target. I gave it about another second or two; and realizing it was not producing the required thrust I rejected the takeoff. We were definitely below 80 knots; as the First Officer had not called '80' yet; but I don't recall the exact speed.We cleared the runway and I advised the passengers and flight attendants that we had a minor engine problem that we had to check out and that I would get back to them when I had more information. We reviewed the rejected takeoff procedure; RTO considerations; and the brake cooling schedule. We concluded that no special procedures were needed as we had rejected the takeoff below 80 knots and when we used the brake cooling chart we fell safely in the 'no special procedures required' zone. The First Officer and I then discussed what had just happened. All engine indications at this time were now normal. I felt that maybe because we were rushed due to the landing traffic on short final and that this is a much shorter than normal runway that maybe I rejected too soon and didn't give the engine enough time to 'spool up.'  Maybe we could attempt another takeoff; perform a full static run-up of the engines this time to give the engines the best chance of achieving normal/required thrust and this time we would not be rushed and would be ready/expecting what to look for.

I double-checked the numbers and the logbook to determine if it was actually overflown. Unfortunately; the latter was the case so I placed the aircraft and base out of service then notified the on-call mechanic; and the manager.Going forward; the feeling of being hurried will be a cue to throttle back and be extra meticulous. Paying particular attention to things out of the ordinary will help against complacency. After a few months of slow flight volume; our base conducted [X] flights in [Y] days. That should be a cue to double-check the numbers.One possible control that would also be helpful is to patch the software to highlight inspections that are due within 10 hours in the section of the flight release request. We currently have to enter a password to override inspections that show overdue to complete the flight release request; which is a great prompt. Highlighting inspections due in less than 10 flight hours in yellow may help prevent this kind of oversight in the future.", {"entities": [[2, 9, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [13, 17, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [166, 170, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [199, 204, "CREW"], [283, 293, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [378, 383, "CREW"], [775, 779, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [852, 863, "CREW"], [1109, 1113, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1416, 1420, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["Pushback from the gate commenced while the parking brake was set. The tow bar's shear pin broke.I; the CA; failed to release the parking brake during my pushback flow. Typically; this oversight in a flow would be caused by rushing or by being interrupted. That was not the case here. Even though a mechanical had caused us to change planes and be delayed; I did not feel rushed. Especially since we had to wait 30 plus minutes to be fueled. Most flows have a cadence between the CA and the FO. The pushback flow also involves the gate agent; the lead FA; the Ramp Controller; and the pushback crew. The cadence of this pushback was different because everything had been completed except fueling the plane. The cargo door had been closed and the agents had been on the tug for 30 minutes. As soon as the fueling was finished; everyone was ready to go. The FA left the cockpit and we started our flows. This is where the normal cadence changed. Everyone was ahead of me. The first part of my flow ends with turning on the rotating beacon. Then I ask the FO for pushback clearance and I tell the pushback crew 'brakes released; hold the push. I'll call you back.' This time the FO called for the push before I finished the first part of my flow. The push back crew also called earlier than usual. Just as I turned the beacon on; my FO said: 'cleared to push.' Normally for me; the call to the pushback crew is three steps. The FO states 'cleared to push;' I release the brakes (a physical motion); and I state 'brakes released; cleared to push.' This time I received the 'cleared to push;' I turned on the beacon (a physical motion); and I gave the pushback command. That is the only reason I can figure as to why I skipped releasing the brakes. The FO did nothing wrong. Some call for pushback clearance as soon as the yellow hydraulic pump comes on indicating the cargo door is being shut. This time everyone was ready at the same time; which is not normally the case. I flew two legs the day before after having been off for two months. I had been reviewing my flows; etc. in preparation for returning to the line. I felt completely comfortable and satisfied with those two flights; which; by-the-way were completely 'normal.'Our flows are interrupted regularly. Most of the time it is easy to just start over. I did not realize that I had deviated from my flow. I had been off for a while. My plan was to go to the training center and practice my flows in a procedure trainer before I returned to work; but was unable to due to our training center being closed due to the COVID-19 virus. My practice at home went well. I had flown two legs the day before and all went well. I suppose I was overconfident.

	["Myself and another CFI landed at a non-towered airport that was NOTAMed 'CLSD TO TRANSIENT' aircraft.During the COVID-19 slowdown; our flight school had ceased all student training and was only flying occasional proficiency flights with either a solo instructor or dual instructors. This was a dual instructor flight and the first such dual flight for either of us in over a month (it was solo ops only before this). We had just finished a simulator proficiency flight and headed to the airport. Our profile was local: depart ZZZ1; simulated XC to ZZZ2; diversion to ZZZ then simulated XC to ZZZ3; diversion to ZZZ4 and return to ZZZ1. Landings were planned at ZZZ; ZZZ4 and ZZZ1. We split up the pre-flight and introduced the new sanitizing procedures our school had implemented the day before. Our weather checks were brief; as it was clearly a 'nice' day. METAR; TAF and local radar showed no concerns apart from some turbulent and gusty conditions. No SIGMETs or worrisome AIRMETs. Weight and balance was good and we were pretty familiar with the airports we were going to. I took the first leg to ZZZ. As I began the startup checklist; I remembered I forgot to check the NOTAMs. I asked my co-pilot (another instructor) if he had gotten a chance to check the NOTAMs and if not; could he check while I started up. He responded in the affirmative that he checked. I clarified; confirming that he checked for both airports we intend to land at. Again; he responded in the affirmative; stating we were good to go. With this; we continued on. Upon arriving at ZZZ; we observed and communicated with a local aircraft departing the airport towards the south; presumably doing flight training over the lake. This pilot made no attempt to inform us the airport was closed and his presence left little doubt that the airport was open. We continued inbound; making all the appropriate CTAF calls. When closer; we observed no signage was placed near or on the runway (such as an 'X'). We began doing pattern work and prior to taking off to begin our third lap; a voice on CTAF informed us the airport was closed to transient aircraft (presumably someone in the FBO). Surprised; I apologized and advised we would depart the area after taking off. Upon returning to ZZZ1; I checked and sure enough; there was a NOTAM set to expire within 24 hours stating the airport was closed to transient aircraft. I asked my co-pilot/fellow instructor who had earlier confirmed there were no NOTAMs and he said he must have missed it.-ZZZ was one of only a handful of airports approved for this week's proficiency flight by our flight school. Had it not been listed (or no list provided); it is unlikely we would have gone there. -My fellow instructor confirming there were no NOTAMs.-The current COVID-19 slowdown and new sanitizing procedures had changed our procedures just enough to potentially affect our normal flow of operations.-Observing and communicating with an aircraft departing ZZZ immediately prior to our arrival certainly seemed to end any doubt (if there was any) about the airport's open/close status.-No markings on or near the runway to indicate airport closure.Ultimately there is no excuse. I regret not checking the NOTAMs myself; but I am also disappointed that another experienced instructor missed this vital NOTAM. However; we are all human and sometimes we might miss the handful of coded identifiers that mark an airport closed.

	["Some last minute passengers boarded the airplane. Due to new social distancing guidelines with passengers spreading out throughout the cabin I had a Flight Attendant perform a count. We received a paper CLR from ramp. We entered the information and received good numbers and departed on time. Approximately 5 minutes after departure we received the close out data while taxiing and approaching the end of the runway. I assumed the ZONE data would be wrong; but the total passenger count would be correct. Because I was actively taxiing I asked the FO to resend the data from the FA count. ATC gave us our takeoff clearance which I instructed the FO to reject the clearance and let them know we are working on an issue with our takeoff data. We held short of the runway were I was able to review the correct CLR date from the paper copy and correct ZONE data based on the FA count. We re-sent the data to make sure the data on file last sent was correct. We reviewed that nothing in the takeoff data had changed based on what we had sent prior to departure. The rest of the flight was normal. [X] days later I received notification from our company saying our passenger count was off by 'X'. They stated the auto close out numbers showed XX passengers but our manifest on file was showing YY; a difference of X. I sent my reply to our company stating the story I am telling here to explain the situation and apologize for any mistake on my; or my crews part. The next morning (X days after the flight) I received a reply from the company saying further investigation revealed airline updated there system showing YY passengers and apologizing to me stating our count was only off by 'X' passengers. But based on the original and updated notification I received we had YY both times so we should be correct. I'm filling this out as a precaution if we were off of our count due to any error between the gate agent and FA; the FA count; or our pilot inputs to the manifest. I tried to create time to fix the problem prior to takeoff and double check the manifest for accuracy; as well as the takeoff data. The one thing I failed to do was double check the total count of the auto closeout compared to our [count]. Prior to door close and departure I am fairly positive I asked the FA if her total was verified with the agent prior to closing the door; as this is my normal habit with [passenger] counts; and she said yes. I had a great crew; so I had no reason to doubt the count. To sum up; I am not sure if our count was correct or off by one; but I am extremely sorry for any errors on my part. The cause was the auto closeout data coming through the system after departure while taxiing and automatically sending new takeoff data. When this happens it frustrating trying to re-input all of the corrections and find any required changes. Based on prior flights if there is any change in CLR or passenger counts the closeout will knock out any inputs previously made; and verified by the crew. This can happen several times even if there is no change in closeout data. I'm not sure if the gate agents are clicking to close out the flight more than once or an error trying to transmit or receive the data from the system. This can cause a rushed and stressed environment if the closeout comes within a few minutes from departure. Particularly if the closeout gets sent multiple times with the same wrong data. This gets increasingly frustrating when the data comes in after departure and pushback or while taxiing. Knowing this I tried to do my best to create more time to avoid rushing and give us both (CA and FO) together time to review all of the inputs and verify all of our takeoff data was correct and unchanged. We held short of the runway to accomplish this. A major contributing factor on my part was I failed to look at the takeoff data generated by the closeout to verify the total count. I assumed just the zones would be off. I should not have had that mindset. Because I was taxiing when the closeout data came in I did not have a chance to check the totals before the FO started changing them. Had I caught this we could have called Operations and resolved the issue prior to takeoff. This was also a failure on the FO not to double check the total count prior to making any changes. The FO was a sharp guy and had been performing great so I also trusted he looked at the data before making changes. I should not have trusted and assumed this would have taken place. Another factor could be a counting mistake by the FA or failure to verify the total with the gate agent. A possible issue could be the gate agent just agreeing with the total the FA said and not actually cross checking it with his computer total. But; I have a feeling the root cause; and what actually happened; was the gate agent did verify the correct total with the FA based on the count; but failed to close out the flight prior to pulling the jet bridge.First and foremost require gate agents to close out the flight prior to coming down to pull the jet bridge. Prior to pulling the jet bridge verify we received the close out data. In our case we were operating off of a paper CLR and [passenger] count; no closeout was received until after departure and pushback and we were already taxiing. Require gate agents to split up passengers for social distancing guidelines and not move passenger forward to avoid any weight and balance issues and passengers moving from assigned seats. That way the closeout data will actually be correct and usable and we can mitigate error in the chain such as input error; count error; and verification errors.", {"entities": [[135, 140, "AIRPLANE"], [212, 216, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [275, 283, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [370, 377, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [382, 393, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [409, 415, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [528, 535, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [548, 550, "ABBREVIATION"], [589, 592, "CREW"], [605, 612, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [646, 648, "ABBREVIATION"], [727, 734, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [762, 768, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [986, 993, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1900, 1904, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1940, 1945, "CREW"], [2021, 2028, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2088, 2095, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2219, 2223, "AIRPLANE"], [2342, 2346, "AIRPLANE"], [2679, 2686, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2717, 2724, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3087, 3091, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3485, 3493, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3503, 3510, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3602, 3604, "ABBREVIATION"], [3609, 3611, "ABBREVIATION"], [3677, 3684, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3738, 3744, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3832, 3839, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3987, 3994, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4081, 4083, "ABBREVIATION"], [4189, 4196, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4229, 4231, "ABBREVIATION"], [4301, 4303, "ABBREVIATION"], [4573, 4577, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4615, 4619, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4801, 4805, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4967, 4971, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5242, 5250, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5271, 5278, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5288, 5292, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

The complexity of multiple approaches and unfamiliarity with operations at ZZZ airport inside ZZZ Approach airspace led to a missed readback error while we were formulating a plan how to deal with the situations.     I had a Aircraft X northwest bound at XX0 and an Aircraft Y southwest bound at FLXX0 who needed lower to also do multiple approaches at ZZZ with all the other aircraft doing the same.

Instead of the Aircraft Y saying Aircraft Y descending to ZZ0 altimeter 30XX; he said 0XX ZZ0 Aircraft Y. When I heard 0XX I looked for a data block with a 0XX in it not realizing it was the Aircraft Y clipping the altimeter and saying it first so I missed the ZZ0 part.Center is working sectors combined with fewer people than normal which is fine; but now just this week they now have us doing ZZZ1 Approach and ZZZ Approach during hours we normally do not work Approach Control.

When the radar showed Aircraft Y at XX7 the Controller issued a climb clearance to Aircraft Y and a descent clearance to Aircraft X.  Numerous calls for coordination was being accomplished by the X-side around the time of the incident.Due to COVID-19; 3 TRACONs are on reduced operating hours; ZZZ2 TRACON; ZZZ1 TRACON; and ZZZ TRACON.  ZZZ ARTCC new specialty controllers are tasked with assuming the airspace for a longer time with a substantial increase in traffic in the morning hours.  By the X o'clock hour ZZZ2 TRACON and ZZZ1 TRACON have assumed their airspace. The issue lies with the late opening of ZZZ TRACON. There is a major increase in traffic the hour before they open with arrivals; departures; overflights; military flights; and practice approaches. These are operations that increase the complexity and mental fatigue of the controllers that are unfamiliar with conflicting approaches; missed approach procedures and coordination with towers. I recommend that ZZZ Approach still stay open for the total hours they feel will increase the safety of their workforce; however as soon as practicable shift the operating hours 1 hour earlier to control traffic their facility is accustomed to working on a daily basis. This will decrease ZZZ's Center's workload to a greater level of safety and increase the level of safety in ZZZ TRACON's airspace during this morning traffic period.", {"entities": [[55, 63, "CREW"], [120, 128, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [227, 235, "CREW"], [306, 314, "CREW"], [366, 376, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [437, 445, "CREW"], [678, 688, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [742, 751, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [979, 989, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [997, 1006, "AIRPLANE"], [1150, 1159, "AIRPLANE"], [1336, 1344, "CREW"], [1353, 1361, "CREW"], [1399, 1407, "CREW"], [1486, 1494, "CREW"], [1684, 1692, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1742, 1750, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1913, 1920, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2006, 2016, "CREW"], [2026, 2031, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2062, 2069, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2261, 2267, "ABBREVIATION"], [2274, 2280, "ABBREVIATION"], [2290, 2296, "ABBREVIATION"], [2480, 2486, "ABBREVIATION"], [2496, 2502, "ABBREVIATION"], [2576, 2582, "ABBREVIATION"], [2718, 2728, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2855, 2865, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2867, 2882, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2945, 2953, "CREW"], [3306, 3312, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

The flight was originally blocked for 10 hours and 45 minutes; however; about 3 and a half hours into the flight there was a medical emergency that resulted in the contacting of Med-link; the utilization of medics on board the aircraft; and essentially the use of said medics finger prick stick to check the affected passengers oxygen levels. Upon completion of this check; the finger prick stick was placed in the red sharps container retrieved from our EEMK (emergency medical kit) for disposal. This container was then wrapped in a red hazardous bag and placed in the aft lavatory to be locked off. The medical emergency resulted in our diversion into ZZZZ1. While on the ground; several beverage services were provided based on the time experienced on the ground. Prior to departing; it was asked if trash could be removed from the aircraft to free up space for the continuation of the flight; unfortunately the ground representative was unable to assist and implied the trash must remain on board. Once back in the air to continue on to ZZZ another passenger appeared to us ill. They filled several air sickness bags of vomit which were also collected; wrapped in a red hazardous bag and also placed in the aft lavatory that had been locked off on the previous portion of the flight. After providing the final service and setting up for final trash pick up; we were unable to create any further space to dispose of trash so that too was stowed in the aft lavatory that had already been closed off for the remnants of our medical emergencies.I am aware stowing trash and locking off the lavatory is against regulation; but being that the lavatory was already being used for bio hazardous waste we did it. Any suggestions for future experiences of this or was this an acceptable action?", {"entities": [[1095, 1104, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["Before boarding I notified agent and 2 flight service personnel that passenger in seat XX needed to be moved away from my jumpseat for social distancing. The seat is directly facing the YY jumpseat. I have legitimate concerns of contracting COVID -19 when seated directly facing a passenger in such close proximity. I confirmed a 2nd time with the agent that I wanted the passenger moved. Flight service informed me that the passenger would be moved to a different seat. I was satisfied with the answer and boarding began. As we reached the end of boarding I observed that the passenger still seated in original seat; our legs would also be extremely close; was coughing; and was not wearing a mask. A different agent came aboard aircraft and I notified her that he was supposed to be moved. She responded that she had no idea what I was talking about. I requested flight service to return to the aircraft. Flight service stated that the flight was at complete [XX]% capacity and they couldn't move him because no other seats available.  They informed me that if I was scared I will just be removed (without pay; missed trip; disciplinary action). I asked flight service for a few minutes to allow him to gather my options which now meant delaying the flight. I briefed Captain on what was transpiring. I was informed that I would be disciplined if I chose not to work the flight and the guidelines states it is sufficient enough if both passenger and I have on masks while facing each other. I asked flight service if they had extra masks to provide passenger; which they did not. I spoke with passenger regarding wearing a mask which; although disgruntled; he was able to produce from his carry on luggage.  I returned to boarding door and informed flight service that I would work the flight.  Boarding door was closed quickly and we rushed to push the flight.  Through all of the confusion I did not brief my exit rows. After arming my doors and completing All Call; I went directly into the lav in an attempt to gather my composure; completely forgetting that X people in the exit row needed a manual safety demo as their monitors were stowed. The chaos and confusion while boarding; the lack of clear and concise communication from flight service; coupled with my fear of how to protect myself from contracting COVID-19 led to my lack of focus and poor performance of required duties.", {"entities": [[82, 86, "AIRPLANE"], [158, 162, "AIRPLANE"], [465, 469, "AIRPLANE"], [612, 616, "AIRPLANE"], [1270, 1277, "CREW"], [1733, 1737, "AIRPLANE"], [1806, 1810, "AIRPLANE"]]}],

	["Was cleared to land on Runway XXR at ZZZ; airspeed was approximately 5 knots higher than usual on approach. Made a normal; smooth touchdown on XXR prior to Taxiway 1.

The aircraft exited the runway pavement between Taxiways 1 and 2 and the remainder of the rollout was on the grass infield between Runways XXR and XXL until reaching Taxiway 2. Then taxied onto Taxiway 2 and; after receiving clearance; taxied the aircraft normally across Runway XXR to parking. The aircraft sustained minor cosmetic damage and there were no injuries. It was a solo flight. ZZZ Tower had inquired after the rollout as to whether any assistance was required to which I replied in the negative.Factors which I believe contributed:1. Due to Covid 19 pandemic and aircraft being in annual for a month did not have much recent flight experience.2. Due to Covid 19 pandemic; had to order shoes online; instead of being fitted in a store; which were heavier than expected and worn for the first time during this flight; which resulted in less rudder sensitivity and probably decreased ability to control aircraft on rollout.3.Crosswind force taking effect almost immediately upon initial rollout right after touchdown.4. Airspeed 5K too high on touchdown.5. Failure to react quickly enough due to lack of recent flight experience in regards to a go-around; though still not sure a go-around would have helped.6.

	["We departed ZZZ. We had received a short-range clearance via the ZZZZZ1 Departure Procedure to the ZZZ1 VOR with a climb to 9;000 and as part of the clearance; told to expect filed route and altitude within 10 minutes \u2026. The routing I had filed was ZZZ ZZZZZ1 ZZZ1 ZZZ2.The copilot is a very experienced pilot; but new to both the aircraft and the older avionics in the aircraft. During the climb; we were given a heading of 340 degrees and cleared to climb to 12;000 feet MSL. Shortly afterwards; we were issued our 'filed route' with the exception that ATC added ZZZ3 and ZZZ3 005/060 to the route prior to ZZZ4 and to climb to 14;000 feet and a new heading was issued to intercept the ZZZ3 005 radial. The aircraft is equipped with older EFIS and FMS. We were climbing very quickly and somehow we missed selecting the altitude preselect arm. We had briefed the need to always arm and altitude selector with each and every change in altitude and to also verify that it was armed 1000' prior to the preselected altitude. I realized that we were probably close to intercepting the assigned radial and rather than ask my copilot to set things up in an FMS that he was still unfamiliar with; I put my head down to program the FMS with the new routing. The copilot called out the altitude deviation as we were going through 14;300 at a high rate of climb. It took another couple of hundred feet to arrest the rate of climb and work our way back to 14;000 feet.I believe that there were several factors involved in this incident. First and foremost; as PIC; I simply failed to properly manage my inexperienced (in that aircraft) copilot. I failed to follow the principle of AVIATE; NAVIGATE and COMMUNICATE.Contributing factors were that we were both rusty - our flying had been significantly reduced due to the COVID-19 quarantines. [X] days before the incident we had flown the aircraft [X] hours on a series of test flights. Prior to that; the last time we had flown the aircraft was over two months ago.Additionally; the Tower personnel at ZZZ could have issued a more appropriate short-range clearance out of ZZZ. I have received the 'ZZZ3 ZZZ3005/060...' routing many times in the past for northbound flights out of the ZZZ4 area when departing out of ZZZ5 which is north of ZZZ4. However; this was my first flight northbound out of ZZZ which is south of ZZZ2. In the past; on departures out of ZZZ to the South; East and West; the clearance received when contacting ZZZ4 Approach was actually the same as what I had filed. I know that this information is available to the ATC staff at the ZZZ Tower; or should be; because after the fact; I checked my email and discovered that [company] had sent me an email giving me the 'Expected ATC Routing' for the flight that included the 'ZZZ3 ZZZ3005/060' between ZZZ1 and ZZZ2. Having this information included in the 'expect...' clearance issued prior to departure would allow flight crews to program their nav systems prior to takeoff. It is a very simple thing that reduces workload and would therefore enhance safety.Finally; as a flight crew; we debriefed the event and discussed the appropriate techniques and safeguards that we need to strictly follow as we resume flying.", {"entities": [[3, 11, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [72, 81, "CREW"], [104, 107, "ABBREVIATION"], [115, 120, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [304, 309, "CREW"], [391, 396, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [452, 457, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [461, 472, "ALTITUDE"], [473, 476, "ABBREVIATION"], [555, 558, "CREW"], [621, 626, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [630, 641, "ALTITUDE"], [741, 745, "ABBREVIATION"], [750, 753, "ABBREVIATION"], [763, 771, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1151, 1154, "ABBREVIATION"], [1224, 1227, "ABBREVIATION"], [1346, 1351, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1379, 1391, "ALTITUDE"], [1414, 1419, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1445, 1456, "ALTITUDE"], [1866, 1871, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1960, 1965, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2021, 2026, "CREW"], [2237, 2246, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2474, 2482, "CREW"], [2575, 2578, "CREW"], [2596, 2601, "CREW"], [2735, 2738, "CREW"], [2974, 2981, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3217, 3223, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

	["This was my first training flight in furtherance of a CFII rating. I received my CFI rating and have not flown as an instructor pilot since receiving my rating.My CFI-I instructor pilot for today's flight was someone I met over the phone. This morning was my first in person meeting with him. Prior to today's flight; I have [XX] hours of CFII ground instruction with a different instructor.Last evening; I prepared for the flight by organizing my instrument instructor materials and monitoring the weather. I used Foreflight to monitor the weather checking METAR; TAF and MOS for the morning. At the time; the weather was reporting morning calm winds; good visibility and winds increasing in intensity to over 20 knots by the afternoon. Our flight was scheduled for 2 hour flight time; so I believed we would be completed before the wind front moved through the area.This morning; I checked Foreflight weather again - METAR; TAF; MOS and winds aloft prior to leaving the house. The current and forecast weather was not significantly changed from the evening prior. I did note the winds aloft at 6;000 was over 20 knots and at 3;000 was in the teens. I do not recall the exact winds. During my drive to ZZZ; I listened to local area forecast on the radio which confirmed what I already knew regarding the weather and wind.Good night's sleep; no health issues; no alcohol consumption in probably 3 or 4 weeks. Hydrated and personally fueled. No home or work related stress. I am; however; driven by college course requirements to complete my overdue CFI-I training which - I had hoped - to do by the end of [month].On arrival at ZZZ; the winds were calm. We met at XA:00; briefed our flight training for the morning with the intent to review avionics. We also reviewed CFII flight standards and best practices for instructors. I would be flying from the Right Seat for the lesson.At approximately XA:45; we left for the hangar. I noted the winds had started to pick up. We conducted pre-flight inspection of the aircraft together and departed ZZZZ for the practice area without incident. ATIS reported winds 260@12knots peak gust to 17.Flight training was uneventful and as planned. I set up for the Approach to ZZZ; under view limiting device; and contacted Approach for the practice approach. ATIS report was unchanged from our departure; winds 260@12 peak gust to 17. I flew the approach and after passing the final approach fix at 2;000 feet; I added one notch of flaps and reduced power for the descent. At the time; I called out the approach speeds out-loud. Approximately 2 -3 miles from the threshold I added a second notch of flaps; I removed the view limiting device. I commented that I was keeping a bit more power in; at 1700 RPM; to compensate for the windy conditions and would not add additional flaps. I believed I was flying a stable approach and was on glidepath to land on the 1;000 feet runway markings. I reduced power upon crossing the threshold to about 1200 - 1300 RPM.Approximately 200 feet before the 1;000 foot marker I was beginning the landing flare when we encountered a wind gust that caused the plane to balloon. I recovered and started a landing attempt when a second gust put us on the ground and the aircraft porpoised twice. I continued moving down the runway and taxied to the hangar. As we were departing the runway; ATC reported a wind gust to 19 knots.During post - flight inspection; we noticed about a small bend on the prop tip.Chain of Events:- New instructor to me- Current but not proficient in the type aircraft since my last flight in almost a year.- Current; but had not flown in over a month; rusty.- Failed to give the surface winds the attention I should have. I was watching the weather; but was (a) eager to get back into the air; (b) I failed to recognize the hazard it created given my level of proficiency from lack of flying in the last 30 - 90 days; and; (c) failed to recognize that the cross wind component on landing was close my personal minimums given my flight recency.- At the FAF; I called out the landing airspeeds and recognized the wind conditions required compensation which I also said; out loud; about 2-3 miles from the threshold. I still felt comfortable with the approach and noted - out loud - the position of the windsock almost down the runway.- When at the flare near the touchdown point encountering the gust of wind - which in hindsight; was probably a wind shear - and aircraft ballooning; I failed to take immediate action. The chain of event culminating in the aircraft porpoising and the prop striking the runway.LESSONS LEARNED -- Given the weather forecast of increasing winds; I should have realized that my personal minimums would be near the limits at the time we would finishing the lesson. In fact; the winds performed exactly as forecast. At this point I should have postponed the lesson; but I was driven by a desire to get back in the plane from such a long period of time and start my CFII training.- Since I had not flown in this type aircraft in almost a year and; again; given the wind forecast; I should have postponed the training flight for another day.- During the approach; I took note of the increased winds and the need to compensate with pitch and power and flaps to mitigate against what eventually happened. My inexperience was overcompensated; however; by my belief that I was maneuvering the aircraft in a stable approach for landing and that 'I could do it.'- At the flare; when the wind ballooned the aircraft I failed to immediately initiate a 'go around' by adding full power and flying the aircraft. Instead; I forced the landing by trying to salvage it when a second gust put us on the ground and porpoising twice. I believe this was caused by me not reducing enough power coming over the threshold and landing with too much speed. Again at the first indication of a bounce; and giving the windy conditions; I should have immediately applied power and initiated a go-around.CORRECTIVE ACTIONS I SHOULD HAVE DONE:- Immediately; and without hesitation; initiated a go-around. That is the safest thing to do.- Postponed flight training due to the windy and gusty conditions; my limited flying during COVID-19 restrictions; and my lack of recent experience flying this type aircraft.- Discussed during pre-flight with the flight instructor my lack of recency in this type aircraft and the winds reaching my personal minimums around the time our lesson would conclude.Finally; I am glad no one was injured and the aircraft is repairable. This was a very hard lesson for me; but one that will resonate for the rest of my flying career and one that I can/will share with others.", {"entities": [[499, 506, "WEATHER"], [541, 548, "WEATHER"], [611, 618, "WEATHER"], [641, 645, "WEATHER"], [658, 668, "WEATHER"], [834, 838, "WEATHER"], [839, 844, "WEATHER"], [903, 910, "WEATHER"], [1004, 1011, "WEATHER"], [1305, 1312, "WEATHER"], [1317, 1321, "WEATHER"], [1648, 1652, "WEATHER"], [2124, 2128, "WEATHER"], [2358, 2362, "WEATHER"], [3100, 3104, "WEATHER"], [3105, 3109, "WEATHER"], [3200, 3204, "WEATHER"], [3369, 3373, "WEATHER"], [3374, 3378, "WEATHER"], [3731, 3738, "WEATHER"], [3952, 3956, "WEATHER"], [4101, 4105, "WEATHER"], [4384, 4388, "WEATHER"], [4392, 4396, "WEATHER"], [4434, 4444, "WEATHER"], [4627, 4634, "WEATHER"], [5080, 5084, "WEATHER"], [5495, 5499, "WEATHER"], [5684, 5688, "WEATHER"], [105, 110, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [128, 133, "CREW"], [180, 185, "CREW"], [558, 563, "ABBREVIATION"], [919, 924, "ABBREVIATION"], [1249, 1254, "AIRPLANE"], [1837, 1843, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1919, 1925, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1982, 1992, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2033, 2041, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2087, 2091, "ABBREVIATION"], [2199, 2207, "CREW"], [2258, 2266, "CREW"], [2284, 2292, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2294, 2298, "ABBREVIATION"], [2372, 2376, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2381, 2389, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2412, 2426, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2434, 2444, "ALTITUDE"], [2499, 2506, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2538, 2546, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2598, 2607, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2834, 2840, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2850, 2858, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2883, 2887, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2895, 2905, "ALTITUDE"], [2906, 2912, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2913, 2921, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [2957, 2966, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3006, 3014, "ALTITUDE"], [3026, 3036, "ALTITUDE"], [3288, 3294, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3299, 3305, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3313, 3319, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3332, 3341, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3346, 3352, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3354, 3357, "CREW"], [3619, 3624, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3875, 3881, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4193, 4202, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [4238, 4246, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4351, 4360, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4591, 4597, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [5013, 5018, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5168, 5176, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5424, 5432, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5559, 5568, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5595, 5601, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [5806, 5815, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [6270, 6276, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6315, 6325, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [6632, 6638, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

I told her it was okay with me if she was comfortable with doing so; but that was the last communication that we had. After takeoff; I had a sudden realization that the passenger may have moved and that the passenger data/distribution from the auto-closeout may differ from our actual passenger distribution; therefore affecting the accuracy of our weight and balance and manifest. I had the FO call back to the FAs; who confirmed that the passenger did in fact move. After landing; the FA told me that she did not realize that we needed the updated passenger locations for our manifest/weight and balance numbers. This event was caused by a lack of communication by both parties. By not closing the communication loop; there was information that was not conveyed correctly and therefore caused a breakdown. The lack of further information from the FA led me to the assumption that the passenger was not moved; whereas in her opinion I had given her the OK to do whatever she needed to do and there was no need to report back with any changes. Additionally; we are so used to flights being full and the auto-close out process being so automated; that moving passengers is a relatively new occurrence that none of us were necessarily expecting; but that we should be aware of and expect to occur more in the future.During unprecedented times such as these where passenger loads are extremely light and the need to distance passengers may be necessary; and where the weight and balance process is now very streamlined and automated; it would be a great reminder for all crewmembers to be aware of the necessity to maintain accurate record of passenger location; and update the data in the MCDU to reflect where passengers are actually seated if it differs from the auto close-out data.

This was brought to my attention; pilot flying quickly corrected the error; and we resumed cruise flight at FLX70. No other aircraft were around us and nothing was said to us by the Center Controller. Flight continued uneventfully.Ultimately both the pilot flying and I were distracted and tired. Both of us had reported in a tiredness the night before after several long tough days. Neither one of us got the amount of quality of sleep we wanted for that day. In addition; we were in an in depth discussion on current events and I believe that added to the distraction. We were in the block FLX50-FLX70 but level at FLX60 when the pilot flying communicated and decided to climb to FLX70. I acknowledged that; but failed to realize that the altitude selector was never reset from FLX60 to FLX70. Under normal circumstances I would have trapped that error; but I believe the aforementioned factors contributed to me missing this detail.This was a breakdown of SOP. Both of us are to blame for letting our guard down and not remaining diligent despite the fact that we had now flown together enough to trust each other. Sometimes it creates more errors when you trust the other person too much; it makes it easier to deviate from SOP. I believe this error was caused by a multitude of factors which have been mentioned above and to prevent that in the future requires more diligence on my part and the part of the pilot flying.\nWhile in the block FLX50-X70; we were level at FLX60. We had become light enough to climb to FLX70 so I notified the FO that I was doing so. For whatever reason; this time I selected the climb mode without resetting the Altitude Selector first. We'd had a couple challenging days with schedules and passengers and were also distracted by a sensitive conversation about COVID-19. We agreed afterward that we were more tired than we realized. I caught the error as we approached FLX75 doing 200 FPM. The last altitude I remember seeing in my scan was FLX68; when I made a subtle mental note that we should be level in a minute. The total deviation was 500 feet and ATC never said anything to us as I descended back down to FLX70. I checked the TCAS both Above and Below on the 50 nm scale and didn't see any aircraft anywhere on the map. Fortunately we were in relatively empty airspace controlled by Center. I don't know why I didn't set the altitude first. That is certainly not normal practice for me so I guess it was the cumulative effect of being tired and being distracted by a conversation about a sensitive subject.Both crew members being more tired than we realized. Being distracted by a sensitive conversation about COVID-19. My deviation from SOP and the FO's failure to monitor the SOP.If any one of the factors of SOP deviation; conversation distraction; or fatigue is removed; it wouldn't have happened.

	["My home airport is a class D located just outside the ZZZ terminal Class B area.

The weather was clear and I climbed into Aircraft X and departed to the south. I got an early frequency change and got the weather at ZZZ; spoke to ZZZ Approach and asked if I could land at ZZZ. I told ATC I wanted a full stop and taxi back for immediate departure. ATC gave me a squawk code and instructed me to ident. Moments later ATC informed me he had radar contact and gave me a heading of 320 into Class B and to climb and maintain 1;600 feet for vectors to Runway XXL at ZZZ.  I repeated the instructions and complied. I was vectored towards ZZZ Airport and then handed off to the Tower for landing. I switched to ZZZ Tower and was cleared to land. The landing was great and I was the only aircraft on the tarmac. I was given taxi instructions for departure on XXR; and asked if I could get vectors to ZZZ1 for a low approach. After departure I was given a heading and altitude for ZZZ1. I executed the low approach for Runway XY at ZZZ1 and then climbed for vectors to the north. I was told to fly to X location to maintain 1;500 feet. The X location was right in front of me with the beautiful city skyline to my left. As I passed over the X location and continued north; it occurred to me that I never heard 'Cleared into the Class Bravo.'  I was given vectors to land at ZZZ; but ATC never said those magic words. I had forgotten to confirm with ATC prior to entering the Bravo if I was cleared; it was just assumed since I was given a discreet transponder code and vectors to land at ZZZ.

During the descent ATC requested us to maintain 310 knots and then comply with speed restrictions at ZZZZZ.  Selected speed intervene and reset crossing restrictions on MCP because we were now in VNAV SPD vs VNAV PATH.  Aircraft was still in VNAV SPD passing the ZZZZZ intersection; so we were continuing to reset the altitudes causing a higher workload than usual.  Approaching the ZZZZZ2 intersection we changed to the final Approach Controller and were given a change to intercept the Runway XYL transition for the ILS and descend to 7;000 feet. I did not enter the runway and transition in adequate time to prevent flying through the course.  When ATC asked if we had intercepted I replied we had not and were given direct ZZZZZ3 for the ILS.Many factors lead to this deviation.  First; since the COVID flight reduction I have only flown 3 trips and am not as proficient as before.  Second; I am not that familiar with ZZZ and am not accustomed to last minute changes since I fly into mostly continent X destinations.  Third; the confidence of runway assignment due to our gate location on the side of the airport.  And lastly; the knowledge that there were so few airplanes flying into ZZZ during the pandemic that the need for a last minute change was not anticipated.\nDid not intercept the correct runway arrival transition in ZZZ due to a late change to clearance.Flying into ZZZ on the cleared ZZZZZ ZZZ1 RNAV arrival with Runway XX in the FMS.

The FO was still adjusting speed and making sure the altitudes on the arrival were made; so not reading notes for XXL vice XY on the ZZZZZ1.

	["Flying into ZZZ at 2;500 feet with VFR conditions ATC was vectoring us for the approach to XXL.  It was XA:00pm and we were the only airplane in the sector due to the COVID flight reductions. We were on a downwind when we were asked if we had the airport in sight for a visual approach. I said that I did and the FO was comfortable with my decision.  This is where all the mistakes started.I failed to communicate my plan on how to fly this approach. I disconnected the autopilot.  I proceeded to the FAF ZZZZZ and told the FO to select 1;500 feet the altitude for ZZZZZ and started to descend in FLCH.  Since I haven't flown much since the flight reductions I'm embarrassed to admit my flying skills were very poor.  I descended to 1;300 feet at ZZZZZ as I made the sharp turn to intercept.  The FO was giving me good guidance but the long day; lack of currency and tunnel vision for the runway made me just not hear his excellent CRM  prompting.  Again; I'm embarrassed to say from ZZZZZ  to  below 1;000 feet I got below the glideslope twice.  At 500 feet we were stable and landed.  I should have gone around; but like the many pilots before me that have written scenarios of unstable approaches; I didn't.  Why not?  Because it was VFR; because it was an easy approach; because I could do this. All the reasons that lead to unstable approaches.

Don't have a big ego and Go-Around.  It's not a failure.  I know all of these lessons; but failed to execute them.

	["Guidelines impose a requirement for Flight Crews to wear face covering masks. It appears there is a diversity of opinion in the medical community about the efficacy of wearing non-surgical masks to stop the spread of disease; and there is also a diversity of opinion about the health risks associated with the routine wear of face masks by otherwise-healthy individuals. Some medical professionals and associations advise that the routine wearing of face masks may present the following health risks for individuals: 1. Increased chance of dizziness; hypoxia; hypercapnia; and headaches; 2. Increased risk of viral infection; due to increased touching of the face; as a result of the novelty and discomfort of wearing a mask; 3. Increased chance of infection; as a result of prolonged use of a contaminated; single-use mask; 4. Increased chance of infection; as a result of exhaled air being directed into the eyes; causing an uncontrolled response to touch or rub the eyes; 5. A decrease in the body's innate immune response; as a result of the increased viral load resulting from the creation of a moist habitat that sustains and encourages viral activity; 6. A decrease in the body's natural immune response; as a result of diminished exposure to the natural flora that create and maintain a robust immune system. This leads to the following concerns: 1. An increased risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia is incompatible with safe flight operations. Although guidelines do not require the use of face covering masks inflight; it does require Crews to wear them immediately prior to flight; and makes their inflight use optional. Before we mandate the use of these masks for Crews who are about to operate an aircraft--or permit their optional use for Crews in flight--we should first conduct a risk analysis. It appears guideline hints at FAA approval for this practice; but it appears that the FAA SAFO 20009 on this subject was simply reinforcing generalized CDC guidance about the wear of face masks in public; without specifically addressing the unique situation of Flight Crew Members who are about to operate (or are actually operating) an aircraft. It is not clear from SAFO 20009 that the FAA did an appropriate medical study to determine if it was safe for Flight Crews to be exposed to an increased hypoxia and hypercapnia risk immediately prior to or during flight. Furthermore; the SAFO does not require operators to analyze this risk; and instead only directs them to address complications surrounding the donning of oxygen masks. Unless the FAA or the Company has conducted a study to evaluate hypoxia and hypercapnia risks; in consultation with aviation medicine professionals; it seems premature to apply the generalized CDC guidance for members of the public to the special and unique work environment of Flight Crews who are operating or about to operate an aircraft.2. Since Flight Crews lack the ability to adequately disinfect face masks during their extended travels; and since the Company is unable to adequately supply Flight Crews with an appropriate number of single-use face masks to permit regular replacement; it is possible that our flight crews may be more susceptible to self-induced contamination if they are required to wear masks. 3. There appears to be a risk that extended use of the face covering masks could actually result in a decline in the immune system of otherwise-healthy flight crews--something that would result in greater susceptibility to viral infection in the long term; including the COVID-19 virus that these measures are meant to defeat. While well-intentioned; it's very possible that we could be hurting the health of our Employees and creating the potential for increased sick calls with a mandatory wear policy--the opposite of what we hope to achieve with a mandatory wear policy.If an appropriate medical study about hypoxia and hypercapnia risks associated with facial mask use by Flight Crews has been conducted and Flight Crews are simply unaware of it; then the study's findings should be made available to Flight Crews; so that they may be better educated on this subject. In the absence of a suitable medical review that addresses these potential health and safety concerns; it is suggested that the mandatory wear policy should be eliminated until such a study can be completed; to guarantee the safety of our Employees and Customers. Similarly; the possibility that a mandatory wear policy could inadvertently have an overall negative impact on Employee health; instead of a positive one; should be evaluated if it has not been; and weighed against the perceived advantages of such a policy.", {"entities": [[1837, 1840, "ABBREVIATION"], [1893, 1896, "ABBREVIATION"], [2195, 2198, "ABBREVIATION"], [2553, 2556, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],

	["This report is in reference to an avionic anomaly. I recently had a Bendix King KI300 attitude indicator installed in my aircraft along with a Bendix King KI310 autopilot adapter to direct the Bendix King KFC200 autopilot. The back story is my original Bendix King KI256 attitude indicator failed on arrival at ZZZ1 last year. Company Y recommended the KI300 as a replacement AI; and same could be used as a backup AI in the future should I make other avionics upgrades; such as a Garmin G500txi Primary Flight Display. Company Y completed the work and I flew the plane home; a total of 5.6 hours with no known issues.  I embarked on a training flight and found while in ground operations; the AI would indicate a nose low left turn.  Being the flight conditions were Visual Meteorological; I departed the airport.  The AI was slow to respond; but did eventually indicated a wings level attitude.  When entering a standard rate turn; the indicator would show a nose low (up to 20 degrees low) turn to the left. When entering wings level the indicator would show a nose high pitch attitude of +20 degrees.I contacted Company Y; Mr. Y said it must be a bad unit. I contacted Company Z; the manufacturer of the unit for assistance. The unit was removed and sent back for recalibration. Upon return and reinstallation; the unit again failed inflight as previously described. The unit was again removed and sent back to Company Z.  Company Z sent a new unit for installation.  Upon installing said new unit; that unit failed after 1.5 hours of flight while in a standard rate turn in a holding pattern.Bendix King is of no help nor has the installer Company Y been of assistance.  Company Z is befuddled and I have not heard anything further from Company Y; or Bendix King as of this writing.  The plane has been taken to another avionics installer for removal of the Bendix King KI300 and KI310 for installation of a Garmin G500txi and G5 backup attitude indicator.My concern is that this unit (KI300) may fail in IMC and cause a pilot to experience spatial disorientation and subsequent incident or accident.  I would also be concern to have this unit as a backup attitude indicator for any other type of Primary Flight Display.

Weather conditions were very good with unrestricted visibilities; light winds; and some light turbulence.  ZZZ is very well known to both pilots having been home airport to both during their career. The pilots are both PIC's; well acquainted and friendly with each other; and work very well together.  I was PIC; flying the leg from the left seat; and it should be noted this was only my 4th approach and landing in over two months due to COVID-19 related Ops stand-downs and vacation.  Approximately 25 miles south of the airport; we called the airport in sight and were cleared for a visual approach to Runway XL. The airplane was on profile; with appropriate speed and altitude and I began to configure and reduce speed and line up for final approach.  The tuned ILS was on glide path and just left of centerline at about 10 miles out; at flaps 10deg and approximately 220 kts; and already cleared to land. Then; the other pilot asked me about a landmark near the Airport which was off our right wing. It was a clear violation of sterile cockpit and I allowed myself to be distracted during a critical phase of flight and pointed the landmark out to him. When I returned my attention to the airplane; it was quickly evident we were now high; fast; and not configured properly.  I briefly considered deploying all drag possible and diving for the runway but quickly discarded that option.  The other pilot suggested asking the Tower for a left 360 deg turn.  Given that we were approximately 2;500 feet AGL and there was virtually no traffic at the time; I agreed with the suggestion. He made the request to the Tower; it was quickly approved; and I initiated the left 360 while continuing a gradual descent and continuing to configure.  We rolled out of the turn at three miles; on speed; on glide path; fully configured and stable.  We then continued the approach to a normal; uneventful landing.To me this was a clear case of pilot distraction brought on by an egregious violation of sterile cockpit rules by both of us.  Our familiarity with each other and a shared history of operating at this airport led us down the path of complacency.  The surprising thing to me was how quickly the airplane departed from the correct descent profile despite such a brief distraction.  I should have been much more vigilant in maintaining sterile cockpit; especially given my rustiness from a prolonged layoff from flying.  I also believe that over-friendliness and familiarity in a cockpit with your flying partner has the potential to be more dangerous than a crew that doesn't like each other since they are more likely to only focus on the job.

	["After we had secured the aircraft at the gate in ZZZZ; I realized that maintenance stickers had not been written up in the logbook on the ground in ZZZZ1. This was a result of several disruptions that took place on the ground in ZZZZ1. Upon shutdown in ZZZZ1; very quickly the cockpit was swarmed by several people. Loadmaster; Maintenance and local quarantine authorities all congregated in the cockpit area. It was conveyed that before anything could take place on the aircraft until the entire flight crew had cleared the local inspection protocol. This entailed all flight crews leaving the aircraft for a temperature and document check on the outside aircraft steps. In order to get the process of unloading and loading going we all left the cockpit area. Before leaving the cockpit we briefed maintenance on the stickers and the required inspections needed. We were all under the impression that maintenance would complete the inspection and complete the logbook as required. After we had completed the quarantine inspection and reentered the cockpit; we observed the mechanics discussing the stickers. I incorrectly assumed that they had been entered into the logbook as we had received the maintenance release. As I was entering the stickers in the logbook in ZZZZ I realized that ZZZZ1 maintenance had not entered them in the logbook.In the future I will not allow any external influences take priority before all my duties are complete. Also I will start enforcing the no cockpit entering until I have completed all my post flight duties. A suggestion would be to pass the responsibility of writing up the stickers to maintenance as it is a maintenance function. The flight crew is saddled with enough work.\nUpon completing our second flight of the day into ZZZZ and completing the logbook we realized that we had failed to transfer two DMIs (Deferred Maintenance Item) from the first flight to the second. I believe there were several factors that allowed us to miss these items in ZZZZ1. As soon as we had pulled into the chocks in ZZZZ1 ground crew were immediately accessing the flight deck explaining their procedures and informing us that we needed to fill out COVID-19 paperwork; get our passports; and exit the aircraft to meet local customs authorities who wanted to take our temperatures; and take our pictures while holding up our passports. We complied with this and exited the aircraft to follow their procedures. The local authorities then disappeared with our passports and we were sent back to the flight deck. The mechanics also took the logbook off the flight deck while they were doing their work. This created just enough of an interruption and out of the ordinary procedures to distract us from ensuring the logbook was completed properly.I don't feel the flight crews have any business exiting the aircraft in Country X. Even if we have a fever; what are the authorities going to do; forcibly detain and quarantine us for a through flight? Regardless of the distraction; I should have done a better job of making sure all DMIs were transferred to the next flight. I had volunteered to complete the logbook for the Captain and should have ensured it was done correctly. In the future I will always ensure all deferred items are properly transferred.", {"entities": [[610, 621, "WEATHER"], [41, 45, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [71, 82, "CREW"], [277, 284, "AIRPLANE"], [328, 339, "CREW"], [396, 403, "AIRPLANE"], [747, 754, "AIRPLANE"], [780, 787, "AIRPLANE"], [799, 810, "CREW"], [902, 913, "CREW"], [1049, 1056, "AIRPLANE"], [1198, 1209, "CREW"], [1295, 1306, "CREW"], [1482, 1489, "AIRPLANE"], [1628, 1639, "CREW"], [1651, 1662, "CREW"], [1862, 1873, "CREW"], [2337, 2344, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3146, 3153, "CREW"]]}],
	["I was assigned Aircraft X; on the list of things to do was Maintenance Check Manual (MCM) XX-XX-XX. The card was not issued but was there to use as a guide since the aircraft was approaching 48 hours on the ground. I looked over the MCM card and saw GPM XX.XX on the front of card. GPM XX.XX.X covers pitot tube covers and referenced to also use AMM of the particular fleet which in this case was X fleet. I could only find the removal and replacement of the pitot tube in the aircraft maintenance manual. I brought this to the attention of the hangar manager. Manager suggested I get with Engineer X. I also noticed on the MCM XX-XX-XX that there should be an entry in the aircraft log book that pitot covers are installed. Engineer X told me the information I was requesting was in the company repair document and the all fleets maintenance manual.When researching the repair document; [it] referenced the AMM ATA XX ice and rain which gave the circuit breakers used without the warnings associated with specific order of opening the C/B's. The warnings for the order of C/B's is located in AMM XX-XX-XX for the removal and replacement of the pitot tube itself and no sign of pitot covers in the AMM also. When I was in conversation with the Engineer he also said the AFMM covered the same material. I had read the preface of the AFMM and understood it was not an FAA approved manual unless it had an AMOC (Alternate Method of Compliance) with it to make it a legal and legitimate to sign off in the AML. I constantly hear the supervisors X and Y state it is an approved FAA manual and instruct others to use it to sign off the logbook. The Engineer agreed with me and did say it was not an FAA approved manual and only to be used by the engineers. Upon looking into the manual and checking the individual fleets I found that all of the Y fleet had the appropriate references needed along with the GPM for a legal sign off in the logbook. I found many conflicts with other procedures when it comes to disinfection of the aircraft.All of the Y fleets state specific approved chemicals and procedures that are not in line with the AFMM spraying in the aircraft. They simply give a warning to use only the approved maintenance procedures or chemicals in order to not due harm to the aircraft systems. I performed all of my work per the GPM and AMM and the repair document for the placement and removal of the pitot tube covers. My concern is with the inconsistencies of the AFMM and the insistence that the AFMM be used in as a catch all in most situations in sign offs in the logbook and in work cards. The purpose of this report is to bring to light and to get the proper authority to either use the AFMM as a regulatory manual or remove it from all of the procedures.I constantly see all fleets maintenance manual references in work cards and on all information and see inconsistencies in that manual and the individual aircraft maintenance manuals.

Then I asked ATC more than 3 times to confirm to descend below 10;000 ft. with more than 250 kts. high speed. 310 kts. ATC's response was 'Affirmative!' Shortly afterward; ATC told us to maintain 280 kts. or greater until further advised.\nWhile in cruise just before we started our descent; ATC instructed us to increase speed for separation into ANC. During the descent approaching 10;500 ft. ATC instructed us to maintain 280 kts. or better as long as practical.

This was my first flight in over 3 months due to COVID schedule reductions. In the process of all of this; we forgot to get a SELCAL Ck with ZZ Radio. I caught this later in the flight and we did the SELCAL check with ZZ Radio. Flight continued uneventfully.We got busy with multiple tasks in a short period of time and overlooked the SELCAL check. I was using the ZZZ Reference Ck list on my iPAD but since you can't check off the items on the iPad it's not as effective as using the actual paper copy. Also; having not flown in so long creates another challenge as I had probably lost some of my regular flow that comes with flying more regularly.

	["We exited the ramp at Spot X; opposite our normal taxi route due to construction. Ground instructed us to taxi to Runway 27L via 'M; BM6; B.' The Captain identified this unfamiliar route as a threat and we proceeded slowly while referencing JEPPS pg 20-9B; moving map; and taxiway painted references. We completed the left 45 degree turn onto taxiway M then right 45 degree turn then left 45 degree turn onto BM6 and then attempted to acquire signage for Taxiway B while referencing moving map. During these final turns I misidentified Taxiway B and announced the 'second right' as B which was in fact D.Quickly identifying this error I communicated with the Captain that B was at our 2 to 3:00 position. The Captain assessed this required turn of nearly 90 degrees as a threat and brought the aircraft to a stop. This placed us well short of Taxiway D in the vicinity of the intersection of BM6 and B. We came up with a game plan and I communicated with ground that we had missed the turn onto B; were holding short of D; and requested taxi onto D. We were given clearance to taxi via D; give way to an aircraft that had followed us out and was on B; resume our taxi onto B and followed them. At no time did we assess a taxiway incursion. In fact; I recall looking down taxiway B at my 3:00 position after we had stopped. Further movement was coordinated with ground during which I offered our apologies. We received a 'no worries' response and therefore assumed there were no issues.Complicated; unfamiliar taxi route at a familiar airport. Moving map display limitations compared to the more familiar EFB. Taxiway signage (paint) limitations at LFPG when taxiing outbound. Usage and thorough preflight study of STR Departure routes identified on JEPP 20-10C (North Route 21; North Route 22). IE: 'Left-right-left-right'\nWe exited the ramp via M instead of our normal route via Taxiway B since B is under construction. Our instructions from ground control to Runway 27L were via 'M; BM6; B'. This new routing was definitely a threat as those taxiways in that area are very confusing and neither of us had ever exited this direction. The signage is terrible and confusing. I taxied very slowly to allow my First Officer time to identify The proper turns using letters painted on the taxiways; the Jepp 20-9B page and moving map. I was mostly focused on the taxiway signage or lack thereof with quick glances to the other sources. We got through the turns on M and were on BM6 trying to find the sign for B while referencing the chart/moving map. I was about to turn right on B per the moving map and 20-9B stating my intentions. I did not see a sign for B or M at this point. My First Officer corrected me and stated that Taxiway B was the second right.It turns out that the second right was Taxiway D. We recognized this error a couple seconds too late and I stopped the plane. From our position I could not safely make a turn onto B. I asked the First Officer to communicate our error to Ground Control and tell him that we missed our turn onto Taxiway B and were stopped well short of Delta on BM6. We requested to taxi via D. Ground told us to standby for further instructions. We were given clearance to taxi via D; DA1; B and to give way to an aircraft on Taxiway B. That aircraft had followed us out of the ramp initially. My First Officer apologized to ground for the error and the ground controller said 'no worries'. At no time did we feel that there was an incursion of any kind. We slightly missed our turn; stopped; called ground and got further clearance instructions. We did not venture onto any taxiway without clearance. We just missed the turn to the point that I could not make the initial clearance turn from BM6 to B. There were no other airplanes taxiing in the vicinity except for the aircraft behind us. From ground response of 'no worries' and the constant normal tone of voice we thought there were no issues.Very poor paint signage on the ground. The letters do not go in all directions and there are a lot of tiny crossing taxiways in the vicinity. This in itself makes it complicated. We were both unfamiliar with this route and lack of paint signage going outbound the direction that we were.

	["Taxiing out for takeoff in ZZZ; Ground Control cleared us to taxi to Runway XXL.  One minute later; ATC then said to change runway to XXR.

As we lined up on the runway; the Captain gave me control of the aircraft.  I advanced the thrust levers and called 'Set Takeoff Thrust.'  Approaching what I believe was the 80 knot call; I heard a transmission from ZZZ Tower saying 'Flight XX Cancel takeoff clearance if able.'  The Captain resumed control of the aircraft and rejected the takeoff.  We stopped on the runway; and turned off and queried ATC as to why we were asked to cancel the takeoff.  We were informed that ZZZ Center was having staffing issues and they didn't want us in the air quite yet.  We as a crew felt that was not an appropriate reason to reject given the phase of flight; and because of this we incurred a 30 minute delay and put excessive wear on the tires and brakes on the airplane.  In the future; I would recommend that staffing issues of an air traffic control facility are not justified causes for rejected a takeoff in a heavy jet airliner and once a takeoff clearance is issued; unless there is an imminent emergency; the takeoff is not rejected.\nApproaching 80 kts during the takeoff; ATC said 'Flight AB; if you can; cancel takeoff clearance.'  The 80 knot call was missed and the reject was initiated around 95 knots.  We cleared the runway to the right on XX taxiway and then held on XY taxiway for 20 minutes for the brake temps to decrease from 320 degrees to less than 150 degrees with the fans ON.  As we were waiting; I asked ATC what the reason for the cancellation of the takeoff clearance.  He said ZZZ Center was getting saturated with the current staffing issue.  Runway XXL was closed at our departure time.  We were cleared to cross XXL and cleared for takeoff XXR.  From that clearance to the reject was maybe 2 minutes or so.  While hearing ATC ask us to reject; I didn't know if someone had crossed XXR downfield; were we on fire; was there smoke; was there a vehicle or person on the runway.  Had I known it was for ZZZ Center saturation; I would have elected to continue the takeoff.  Had we continued the takeoff; would we have continued on course; maybe hold or been given vectors; or stay at a lower altitude until ZZZ Center accepted us.  I don't know; but any of those would be a better option than a reject.  If ATC was saturated; whether ZZZ1 or ZZZ Center; having us reject was not the best course of action.  Had we been at a higher speed and still rejected this would have been a lot worse.  Fuse plugs on the mains would have let go causing X flat tires; fire trucks rolled; we'd be unable to clear the runway; and the airport would have closed.

	["ZZZ was using Runway X configuration due to the winds. Aircraft X flew into ZZZ Airspace on the Arrival and was told to report ZZZZZ; expect Runway X. When they reported ZZZZZ; I advised to fly a right downwind for Runway X. In the meantime; I had moved an aircraft on Ground Frequency and also cleared at least two other aircraft the use of Runway X. I cleared Aircraft X sequence and clearance to land Runway X. They read back Runway X. There was one aircraft in the Runway X local traffic pattern and I moved to sequence and clear him behind Aircraft X; but could not find Aircraft X out the window; until I saw him very short final; if not over the threshold for Runway Y. I immediately sent him around and advised I had cleared him for Runway X; told him on climbout to turn left; and fly a left downwind for Runway X. By this time the traffic pattern aircraft was well into the right downwind approaching right base turn. Aircraft X had turned left to join left downwind for Runway Y; conflicting with the traffic pattern aircraft. I told Aircraft X to immediately climb and turn westbound and issued traffic. Aircraft X reported the traffic insight. Thankfully the right base pattern traffic had already started their descent down in preparation for Runway X arrival; but I had not seen that at the time of the immediate climb clearance. I told them to extend out to the shoreline and enter right base Runway X; and asked if they understood that we are landing Runway X; the eastbound runway; and they said yes. I had to point them out to ZZZ1 Tower while they maneuvered back inbound to Runway X. They landed and taxied to park.This could have been a major issue had my pattern traffic; or any other arrivals for that matter been on short final or approach. The pattern traffic aircraft (sorry I forget his call sign) was on the departure end of Runway X and was not affected by the Runway Y go-around.I did not Brasher the pilot because I wasn't 100% sure if I had misspoken and wanted to listen to the tapes.Aircraft X is a student trainer aircraft. There could have been instruction going on and distraction; however the pilot in command read back Runway X several times. The flight school location on the field changed recently- and often for convenience in taxiing; they request to land Runway Y- so there could have been some expectation bias from the pilot going on. I did see two pilots exit the plane when they parked on their ramp.At the time of the incident; I was the only Air Traffic Controller on the clock.

Typically on summer hours; at the time of this occurrence; there would have still be 2 controllers on position and this had a better chance of getting caught sooner and alleviating the situation. To have more eyes in the Tower later in the evening and to accommodate safer operations for everyone; I would recommend some changes to scheduling.

	["I was working the Satellite sector.  I had several aircraft in my airspace on two frequencies and constant shout line communication. I was delivering aircraft to the adjacent sector at even altitudes (correct direction of flight).  ZZZ Tower tagged and coordinated a VFR aircraft with an alternator issue as what I deemed could be a possible emergency; but I was not in communication with the aircraft.  A separate target not tagged indicated 4;000 feet. To prevent a possible conflict I climbed the multiple aircraft I was delivering to 6;000.  This altered the altitude we usually deliver aircraft in that sector.  I received a arrival to ZZZ at 5;000; knowing I would have to separate my arrival from the aircraft with the alternator issue not on frequency I started the aircraft decent earlier than usual. I cleared the ZZZ arrival aircraft to ZZZZZ; the initial approach fix. I descended an arrival aircraft to Runway X based on the lateral course ZZZZZ offered.  The aircraft made a very slow course to ZZZZZ.  Realizing the conflict I issued heading to diverge the courses.

	["Experienced Maintenance delay prior to departure which eventually resulted in an aircraft swap. New aircraft came from hangar and required an additional troubleshoot to clear avionics discrepancy. Asked to refile after cleared to taxi. This was the start of mild mental fatigue. After takeoff we experienced a high workload with multiple heading; altitude and frequency changes. The pilot flying called for the after takeoff checklist. I did the after takeoff flow and ran through the after takeoff checklist. I read the 'thrust rating climb checked' and looked at the climb button to verify that I had pressed it; but failed to specifically look on EICAS to verify that CLB was reflected. When we reached cruise altitude the PF called for the cruise checklist and upon running the cruise checklist we realized that we were still in TO-1 and pressing the cruise button would not change the thrust setting. It became apparent that during the takeoff run the thrust was inadvertently placed in the max power detent and was the reason CLB and CRZ power was not established during the climb. We established CRZ power and continued the flight. Upon arrival I called Operations and was told that because we did not receive any warning/caution/advisory message the aircraft did not require any further inspection.Mild mental fatigue prior to departure due to maintenance delays and trouble shooting. Lack of experience/proficiency and recent experience in 'type.' Mental saturation during a high workload phase of flight. Failure to diligently cross-check while running a checklist.Adhere to SOP and diligently cross-check during checklist execution. The Coronavirus has created an unprecedented situation for all of us. After receiving the minimum IOE; I had only flown four legs when everything shut down in ZZZ. I didn't fly for almost three months. The flight regarding this report was my third leg since the shutdown. I think that the company should be looking more closely at who (while still technically legal) may need refresher training/recurrent/more IOE etc. Currency/consolidation/proficiency isn't just a legality; it is also a factor in the safety of our employees and passengers.\nI was pilot flying.  Upon reaching cruise flight and calling for the cruise checklist (approximately 10 minutes after takeoff); the CA and I noticed that the thrust setting on the EICAS display was showing TO-1 rather than CLB.  When we tried to select CRZ thrust setting; the EICAS still showed TO-1.  It was then that we realized the thrust levers were still in the detent; thus preventing the setting of any other thrust settings besides TO-1.  When we pulled the thrust levers out of the detent and re-selected CRZ; 'CRZ' appeared on the EICAS; and we continued the flight to ZZZ.  After landing at ZZZ; the CA called maintenance to ask if we should write up that the thrust rating appeared to have been left in TO-1 until cruise.  Maintenance said because no warning/caution/advisory messages showed up; we did not need to write it up.I had inadvertently pushed the thrust levers into the detent on takeoff.  I have a habit of glancing at the thrust rating to back up the pilot monitoring after they say; 'After Takeoff Checklist complete;' but I was mildly distracted by the busy departure and did not do that this time.When I am pilot flying; I plan to be careful to continue my habit of checking the thrust rating on the EICAS when the After Takeoff Checklist is complete.", {"entities": [[1464, 1474, "WEATHER"], [12, 23, "CREW"], [119, 125, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [285, 292, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [383, 388, "CREW"], [417, 424, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [452, 459, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [491, 498, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [536, 541, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [569, 574, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [650, 655, "AIRPLANE"], [706, 712, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [744, 750, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [782, 788, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [855, 861, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [941, 948, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1081, 1086, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1352, 1363, "CREW"], [1758, 1763, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1817, 1820, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2194, 2199, "CREW"], [2200, 2206, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2223, 2229, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2257, 2263, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2306, 2313, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2320, 2322, "ABBREVIATION"], [2368, 2373, "AIRPLANE"], [2465, 2470, "AIRPLANE"], [2730, 2735, "AIRPLANE"], [2780, 2787, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2800, 2802, "ABBREVIATION"], [2810, 2821, "CREW"], [2915, 2921, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2924, 2935, "CREW"], [3092, 3099, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3165, 3170, "CREW"], [3324, 3329, "CREW"], [3417, 3422, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
	["The Captain operating Flight AB contacted flight control over SATCOM to request to speak with Dispatch and Maintenance regarding the malfunction of their CPDLC. Maintenance told the crew that if they preferred they could issue an MEL to defer the CPDLC; as long as the Captain and dispatch agreed it was deferrable. The Captain wanted to continue with the deferral and I stated that I would review the route; NOTAMs and Jepp to verify there were no restrictions.  The first step I took was to review the enroute NOTAMs over waypoint ZZZ VOR because that is a known hotspot.  There was a NOTAM for ZZZ1 VOR that stated 'If' the aircraft was capable of logging onto CPDLC that it was preferred for that route.  I interpreted the wording of the NOTAM to mean that it was preferred; but not required. To continue my investigation of the NOTAM over ZZZ1 I searched 'CPDLC' in the state rules and procedures for Country X in the Jepp airway manual text.  Under 'Route 1234; Y1; Y2 procedures' it states 'data link service; CPDLC/ADS-C; is applied to the Routes 1234 [ZZZZZ-ZZZZ]; Y1 and Y2.' And then there is a table for 'Country mainland data link routes operational conditions' and lists CPDLC requirement; again; only for 1234; Y1 and Y2.   Then I searched CPDLC for the rest of the state rules and procedures for the countries along the rest of the route and referenced an email from the training department that confirms that our aircraft; can operate in Continent X with no FL restriction with CPDLC inop. Then I confirmed to the Captain that I could not find any restrictions preventing us from using the deferral and continuing the flight as planned. The CPDLC deferral does require the ATC strip to be modified to reflect the loss of CPDLC; so I attempted to rerun the flight plan; but LIDO was not able to rerun the flight plan and gave an error message that there were no available FL on airway X111. When I reviewed the enroute NOTAMs for X111; there was an airway restriction up to FL310; and I mistakenly assumed that LIDO was misinterpreting the NOTAM and restricting the entire airway then in perfect storm timing the enroute airway restriction NOTAM was canceled and I reran the flight plan (and assume that I mistakenly reran the flight plan without the MEL applied) and was able to run the flight plan on another OFP; confirming my belief that it was just a misinterpreted NOTAM by LIDO.  Then I wanted to be certain that I did not mess with the planned fuel or planned altitudes by simply canceling and refiling the ATC strip on the filed OFP instead of sending a whole new flight plan with a new OFP this was to prevent accidentally changing any current info; due to the flight being ready to block for departure; and also to receive acknowledgment from all countries listed under the ATC filing; which I did receive acknowledgment and no reject from all of them. It was not until I came in the next day that I was informed by a Senior Dispatcher that there were two RNP4 airways that were on the route; X111 ZZZZ1 to ZZZZZ2; and Y999 ZZZZZ2 to ZZZZZ3. I quickly realized that I had been scanning for any restrictions to CPDLC and not also looking for restrictions to RNP4 (which would have led me straight to the RNP4 routes listed in the airway manual text).My suggestions moving forward after reviewing this situation. I felt pressure due to time constraints because 1) The flight was nearing their ETD and the route for ZZZZ1 to ZZZZ2 is notorious for airway closures and I did not want to risk possibly delaying into them; 2) The flight was ready to block and if it was possible to continue with the deferral then I did not want to cause a delay; 3) The Continent X desks (at least mine) are seemingly always setup with flights departing very close to the same time.  I was also responsible for Flight AC ZZZZ3-ZZZZ2 and XXX ZZZ-ZZZZ2 which both departed within an hour of each other and I was already almost an hour and a half behind on planning due to the ZZZZ1 deferral and there are multiple NOTAMs to review for XX and XXX can be time consuming to find an efficient route to cross that is also approved by [foreign ATC]. In fact I had to notify the Supervisor that it was possible that I would not have XXX paperwork submitted in time; but was able to barely make the 2 hour deadline.The next issue was that due to coronavirus separations I was the only dispatcher in Continent X control in my building so I did not have anyone directly next to me to start the dispatch release process and failed to ask my fellow dispatchers on the ocean side for assistance. Lastly; guidelines for constant issues with CPDLC freezing state that if the CPDLC freezes before departure to contact maintenance and have them accomplish the circuit breaker reset procedure. So from now on I will insist that maintenance follow through with this procedure instead of defaulting to a deferral.", {"entities": [[3345, 3353, "WEATHER"], [4636, 4644, "WEATHER"], [4, 11, "CREW"], [29, 31, "ABBREVIATION"], [94, 102, "CREW"], [107, 118, "CREW"], [161, 172, "CREW"], [269, 276, "CREW"], [320, 327, "CREW"], [537, 540, "ABBREVIATION"], [587, 592, "ABBREVIATION"], [602, 605, "ABBREVIATION"], [742, 747, "ABBREVIATION"], [833, 838, "ABBREVIATION"], [1475, 1477, "ABBREVIATION"], [1531, 1538, "CREW"], [1690, 1693, "CREW"], [1888, 1890, "ABBREVIATION"], [1990, 1995, "ALTITUDE"], [2056, 2061, "ABBREVIATION"], [2156, 2161, "ABBREVIATION"], [2387, 2392, "ABBREVIATION"], [2531, 2534, "CREW"], [2801, 2804, "CREW"], [3418, 3421, "ABBREVIATION"], [3749, 3758, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3867, 3875, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [4141, 4144, "CREW"], [4705, 4716, "CREW"], [4813, 4824, "CREW"]]}],
	["After forward entry door closed; I was advised by #1 FA that we had a sick passenger on board; and a CSM had okayed travel by the passenger.  At the same time; I got a call from the #4 FA advising me that the passenger was acting sick/nauseous and disoriented and was causing a lot of concern with the other passengers; who were concerned about their safety and health.  This was the first time I was informed of the passenger issue; CSM never consulted or briefed me.  We had no way to isolate [the] ill passenger.  Contacted operations to have CSM return to aircraft.Was told that passenger had been denied boarding on a previous flight; and paramedics had attended to passenger and okayed the travel; but there was no record of this or witnesses; just what the passenger claimed.  I asked CSM if the passenger's temperature had been taken; it had not.  I asked that be done; but they had to get a thermometer from outside security.While waiting for the thermometer; and after further consultation with the FA's concerning their interaction with the passenger; as well as increasing concern by other passengers about traveling with a passenger that was exhibiting obvious signs of illness of some type; I decided to have the passenger removed from the flight to ensure the safety of my crew and passengers because of the behavior and symptoms being exhibited by the passenger in question and the unknown cause of illness. In my opinion; poor screening by gate and CSM personal; desire to not deal with an issue and try to push it off on the crew; hoping to let the problem be handled by the flight crew and not dealt with by the gate personnel.In these times during a national health pandemic; we need to be more cautious and err on the side of safety for the majority of the passengers and crew rather than avoiding making a decision that affects just one passenger or crew.  We; as an airline; including gate/CSM personnel; need to treat these situations as if the potentially ill passenger is going to go back and sit down next to one of our family or loved ones.  Also; we need to consider the optics of allowing a visibly ill passenger onto an aircraft with a public that has a heightened awareness and concern about the health conditions of other passengers.  Also; the CSM and agents need to get the Captain in the loop about things that are going on his/her aircraft.  I am absolutely floored that the first I heard about this was by my flight attendants after the agent had given me the final check before closing the door.

	["We were cleared for a visual approach Runway X into ZZZ. FO was flying he configured to gear down flaps 30 when the glideslope came alive at the FAF ZZZZZ. The fix is around 3.5 NM from the runway. As we were descending on glideslope I told the FO; that we were at 1;400 feet AFE and to continue slowing down since he was around 165 kts; in order for us to be stable by 1;000 feet; he continued slowing down; and asked for flaps 45 degrees. Unfortunately; by the time we reach 1;000 we were fully configured for landing but too fast; so I told him to go-around and try it again. We completed a go-around per the POH profile; I spoke with Approach and Tower and eventually we received vectors back around to Runway X where we landed without any further issues. They asked the reason for the go-around; I told them it was due to being unstable. Flight attendants and passengers were notified as we were being vectored back to Runway X and After landing and arriving at the gate; Dispatch was notified.I detected our height from the field elevation around 1;400 AFE and noticed that we were still too fast around 165 kts judging our distance from the runway and a 3.0 degree angle glide path; I asked the FO to keep slowing down so we could be stable by 1;000 feet; he did by asking flaps 45 before landing checklist; but by the time we were at 1;000 feet we were too fast still. Therefore; unstable.FO being fully configured by 1;000 feet but too fast. Therefore; not complying with all the criteria required for a stable approach.FO reacted by slowing down and asking for flaps 45 degrees; unfortunately by the time we reached 1;000 feet we were too fast. Therefore; I asked him to go-around and try the approach again.Before the flight; the FO introduced himself and told me he was a low time FO and hasn't flown much in the past 2 months; most likely due to the reduced flying situation the industry is experiencing at the time. He told me he was still low time. He did very well during the entire flight; unfortunately by the time we were executing the approach he started getting behind the airplane by the time he asked for gear down flaps 30; because he thought that he had enough distance to keep slowing down the airplane he took his time; without realizing that the ZZZZZ FAF fix is only 3.5 NM from the runway slightly closer than others standard FAF at different airports/approaches and therefore he should've kept slowing down. I pointed to the fact that we were approaching 1;000 feet around 1;400 feet that and he was too fast still too fast; he reacted by asking for flaps 45 degrees. However; by the time we reached 1;000 feet he was still too fast. He performed the go-around and his second approach was much better. I would say a suggestion for this issue would be to rotate new low time FO's to fly more often whenever is possible.

	["Arriving at ZZZ; after approach check was completed; on a very light traffic day; I was cleared 'ILS X; 2;000 till established.' I stayed at 2;000 until intercepting the glide slope and did not meet the mandatory 1;500 at ZZZZZ. When I checked on with Tower they said; 'I guess Controller gave you relief from ZZZZZ?' We were almost on top of ZZZZZ at this time and could not make the restriction. I don't know why; but I thought; '2;000 until established' gave me relief from the ZZZZZ crossing restriction.1) I was lulled into a false sense of ease. Due to Coronavirus there was very little traffic in X airspace and it was a beautiful visual day. Usually I would have been hyper-alert in that airspace; but it was more like going into non busy area or something. 2) Expectation bias-I expected the clearance to say; '2;000 until established; ZZZZZ at 1;500; cleared for the ILS X.' When Controller cleared me; I thought; 'I don't have to cross ZZZZZ at 1;500; Controller gave me 2;000 until established.' 3) Weak approach brief-my PNF mentioned afterward that he forgot about the mandatory 1;500 at ZZZZZ. Had I briefed more thoroughly; he may have caught my mistake; but since I didn't verbalize the ZZZZZ -1;500 feet restriction; he was not in the loop. 4) I did not verbalize my intention when Controller gave me the clearance- I should have said something like; '2;000 until established; I don't have to make ZZZZZ at 1;500.' My PNF might have then recognized my stupidity.\nArriving into ZZZ I was the pilot monitoring and was on approach control frequency.  We were initially clear direct ZZZZZ1 and later given a heading of 090 to intercept. We were then given 'On heading 090 maintain 2;000 till established; cleared for the ILS X; contact ZZZ Tower.' The PF armed the approach and neither of us took note of the mandatory altitude of 1;500 at ZZZZZ even though both of us have flown this approach many times in the past. When I contacted the Tower we were cleared to land.  Tower then said 'I guess you were given relief on the altitude at ZZZZZ.'  Without thinking I replied 'Yes.'  I then looked at the approach chart and noted the altitude requirement.

	["Local training flight departing home airport of Willis Gliderport (FA44).

Traffic went through our pattern at pattern altitude and was not transmitting or monitoring Willis Unicom. This report is submitted to highlight a recurring risk of mid-air collision over FA44 which I have repeatedly encountered in the last several months due to training aircraft from LNA transiting to or from training areas to our west. These aircraft typically fly through the Willis pattern at 1000 MSL and frequently can be reached still monitoring 122.7 which is the Lantana UNICOM frequency. I've spoke with instructors from Lantana who admitted that they use Willis as a waypoint to avoid antennas just to the north but disregard the hazard of aircraft in the pattern at Willis. At a minimum the flight schools at Lantana need to either utilize Willis UNICOM when transiting or offset north or south to avoid the pattern. As a further indicator of the danger; we had another aircraft fly through the pattern as we returned to land less than an hour after the first occurrence noted above.

	["Bottom line - the re-qualification training courses are unsafe and unacceptable for the timelines a pilot has been off the fleet and position. To be straight; many of us are appalled that the union; the company; and the FAA would have ever signed off on this. The rest of the pilots just do not know what they are in for yet.I have never needed any extra training time nor have I failed any checks in my XY-year career as a pilot. I made the mistake of trusting company judgement after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 when I was displaced off the X/Y fleet (FO) after only my second trip after IOE. I had less than XXX hrs on that fleet and position in those months. I then was able to bid back to it just under X years later. I was put through a 2-day sim refresher and a 3 day PC with 14 days of notice. It was totally inadequate and I had to put in a massive study effort with minimal sleep and still felt that it was all on my shoulders to spool up during that first few months after training. Now; years later; nothing has changed. I have now been surplussed from Captain's seat on the X/Y fleet. Even after X years as a Captain; I cannot hold any the left seat at any domicile on any equipment. I will be an FO once again after having already done that for over XZ years. I have been off the type FO position for over X years; and off the Z fleet Captain position for over X years. I have been assigned a re-qualification X course; which has been deemed as 'sufficient' training.Apparently; we also have made the mistake of assuming the industry has learned from the type situation and the egregious assumptions made that a bulletin and a video would be enough training for pilots to handle all the differences. Many of us are backsliding; taking double demotions in some cases; and some getting furloughed yet again. You are standing by the curriculum that pilots who have been off the jet for nearly five years; just need a quick refresher of a sim; then a PV; another sim; then an MV; and then a loft and an then an LOE. Just imagine doing that yourselves. Also; it is often the case that two FOs get assigned together; so we get even less training in those few days due to having to switch roles and seats.Any pilot off the seat and fleet for more than two years should have a full qualification course. Pilots between 12-24 months should have re-qualification Y; 6-12 months re-qualification X; and 3-6 months re-qualification Z. The alternatives will be pilots needing extra sims; having poor training record marks; failing checks; and not having the knowledge and skill they need restored to fly the line safely. There must be an understanding of both normal ops as well as emergencies. And all training should be to 'proficiency;' not just to 'demonstrated.'We cannot afford to have any incidents/accidents as we try to emerge from this horrible COVID-19 situation. We expect much more from the company; the union; and the FAA in helping to give us adequate training and the tools we need to do the best and safest flying we can; especially now with all of the distractions and pressures.", {"entities": [[100, 105, "CREW"], [220, 223, "ABBREVIATION"], [276, 282, "CREW"], [424, 429, "CREW"], [551, 553, "ABBREVIATION"], [1062, 1069, "CREW"], [1072, 1076, "AIRPLANE"], [1119, 1126, "CREW"], [1155, 1159, "AIRPLANE"], [1207, 1209, "ABBREVIATION"], [1296, 1298, "ABBREVIATION"], [1346, 1353, "CREW"], [1673, 1679, "CREW"], [1857, 1863, "CREW"], [2213, 2218, "CREW"], [2227, 2231, "AIRPLANE"], [2459, 2465, "CREW"], [2598, 2601, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2930, 2933, "ABBREVIATION"], [3022, 3028, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],

I encouraged everyone to stick to SOP and work together as a crew.We pre-flighted the aircraft and I made a point to be diligent. That said; you get interrupted and this was the case with my normal inspection of the circuit breaker panel. I normally do this as so as I go into the flight deck. In this case; the FO was not in their seat fully; so I accomplished some initial items; then stepped back. When I returned; I failed to inspect the C/B panels. If I had; I'd have noticed the collared C/Bs for every probe heater.I went through my overhead flow although I checked the probe heat; I didn't notice that the lights never went out. I think this is possibly due to the fact that every probe heater was ions; so the whole light panel for these probes was lit; as opposed to noticing if only one light failed to extinguish. My error.We continue with our procedures and briefly noticed before taxi that the panel anti-ice light was lit. The FO jiggles the button and it extinguished. We figured it was just the panel acting up; which it often does. This is a human factors issue. We have become so de-sensitized to the panel not working that when we get an indication like this; we think nothing of jiggling the switch and continuing if the lights go out. I have the panel stick many times and often when we check it; it take numerous presses from both pilots to get the system to test. This is normalization of deviation; both from and SOP standpoint; but also from a design and system failure standpoint. We all know this system is poor.When the anti-ice light went out; we continued to takeoff; checking the panel once again; and got no lights. We took the runway and at about 30 knots; the Master Caution light lit up and I took the aircraft and rejected the takeoff. We ran the checklist and cleared the runway to troubleshoot. We had gotten the Master Caution with no associated panel light illuminated. This is not right. We jiggled both panel lights and the anti-ice light in front of the FO came on steady. It should have been on; the entire time. I called Maintenance Control and after talking with the; I taxied back to the gate for maintenance.They discovered that when the aircraft was pulled from storage; that all the C/Bs for the probe heaters were still collared.Takeaways for me:- Late night departure.- Lack of recent experience; proficiency.- Interrupted SOPs during preflight.- Myopia to the illuminated probe heat lights because they were all on. This is not common and doesn't stick out. This may seem strange; but we both looked at the overhead panel numerous times; and even though all the probe heat lights were on; it didn't stick out. If only one had been on; it would have been salient.- The panel system doesn't work right. We all know this and have learned to accept it. That said; I think we all believe this system needs fixing. It sticks and doesn't test very often.\nScheduled push of XA:55 local. 3rd flying leg in the previous 33 days. Due to various reasons both the Captain and I completely missed the CB check during our preflight flow. During the recall test for the after start flow; the MC light and Anti-ice annunciation on the panel illuminated. We checked the overhead panel; and the window heat looked normal (no overheat; all green). We then checked the probe heat panel and all of the amber lights were on; however our brains incorrectly registered it as 'normal' since there wasn't a broken up pattern (expecting to see one or two lights not in the same state as the others). We then retested the recall check it did not illuminate the MC light or any panel annunciations; even during the recall checks of all subsequent flows. During the takeoff roll; before the engines even achieved T/O N1; the MC light illuminated but no panel annunciations illuminated. The Captain executed a low speed RTO and stopped on a taxi way to troubleshoot. We checked and cleared the recall test multiple times because the only light that kept illuminating was the MC. Only after several recall tests did the anti-ice annunciation on the panel illuminate again. After discussing the situation with Maintenance Control we ended up returning to the gate. Operations started asking us questions and troubleshooting the anti-ice systems. After a couple minutes; the Captain realized that we had completely forgotten to check the CBs and we started looking for any popped CBs.

	["Aircraft X was in a storage state during preservation maintenance when an engine run was accomplished on both #1 and #2 engines with their main oil tank empty and their respective main accessory gearbox drained of oil as well. This is an event that is unprecedented; I am here to focus on how serious this is in regards to determining serviceability of the subject engine(s). As an experienced lead AMT; I am no stranger to engine overhaul; test cell duties; diagnostic test flights or on-wing engine/taxi runs. I know how violent an engine reacts when it incurs an internal failure while in operation and to summarize the thought process; it's fortunate that many of these failures happen on the ground during maintenance but some unfortunately happen when an aircraft is in service and in flight.Every engine manufacturer designed these engines to operate normally on different phases of flight under different conditions providing that the operator/consumer; observes; adheres to all or any operational instructions provided. In regards to engine oil quantity; our company pre-run checklist; before an engine is even operated; it must contain a minimum of 1X quarts of main oil quantity as displayed in the flight deck. I have no doubt that an engine will still operate normally with lesser quantity if oil pressure and oil temps remain normal and no other abnormal parameters are observed. If an anomaly does happen during an engine operation that's related to oil and or lubrication system; especially those observed readings that can indicate an impending failure or incursion beyond its operating limits; the engine in operation must be stopped immediately. The company has ample resources available to address or troubleshoot these issues in the form of MMs; FIMs; TSMs; etc.; and likewise; all modern aircrafts has built in systems known as recorder mediums such as PCM; DMU; and FLT RCDR that can be downloaded as necessary to provide insight and health assessment to many operating parameters including engines at real time or recorded. With the issue we have; none of the recording mediums downloaded has provided us with any source of readings and or indications that may shed light as to how we can possibly approach and deal with this problem. Here's the issues that I have: These engines were run with no oil in tank and main accessory gearbox oil was drained as well. With the rate of speed that these engines operate even at idle; there are many parts within the scope of the lubrication systems that is dependent on proper oil pressure in order to maintain normal operating temp such as the huge thrust bearings; sideload bearings and other compartment bearings along with the other critical parts like the scavenge and pressure pumps. Common sense will also dictate that with no oil to begin with; these bearings and critical seals have now been exposed to undetermined excessive heat that may have inflicted heat damage and reduce life cycle on other parts. I have thoroughly searched the MM and TSM in hopes to provide me some insight on how to troubleshoot or address this issue and found none. In fact; due to my curiosity; I have checked all the other fleets troubleshooting manuals and was unsuccessful as well. The only fleet that came close to addressing an oil pressure issue involves the CFM engines and that's whenever its engine oil pressure goes below minimum limits that exceeds 30 seconds; the engine is to be replaced. Engines are just not designed to operate with the oil system drained and it's beyond my scope of knowledge and experience to determine serviceability. Unless an engine manufacturer can provide us insight; recommendations or have experienced a similar event and shares us the information and or make known to us what decision that had to be made; we and the Company is in a serious predicament. What we are being asked as part of the maintenance process are these EG callouts that instructs to check MCDs and perform numerous engine runs as to ascertain and prove its serviceability. These engine runs are unfounded and lack merit and frankly speaking; they are very dangerous. They clearly appear experimental; based on assumptions and not ECRA supported. These proving engine runs are best authorized and done in a test cell environment where it is safe and properly managed. In summation; these engines were not run with a low oil qty condition as many may have thought or have been misled to think. One would argue that it still had oil in the form of residuals in the lines and that would be enough to come to a conclusion that all the bearing compartments and other critical areas were not affected or heat damage is not a factor. These types of arguments are foolish and obviously do not share the same mindset as I and that is to operate with a mindset that's geared towards safety; legality and have a high degree of confidence that the right decision is made; without any doubts or reservations. The public views us as an airline of choice and as we transport them around; they expect guaranteed reliability; safety and comfort. In conclusion; the decisions to be made hinges on two different paths.

	["The flight was to keep me current for both day and night flight. This COVID-19 thing has kept me from flying lately. Typically I do this with a general currency flight that starts during daylight and ends at night; so I can get my 3 landings in. I also go through flight Maneuvers as a part of the currency. That day I did slow flight; Power on and power off stalls as well as steep turns. I was feeling a little disoriented so discretion being the better part of valor I decided to head back to ZZZ. My preparation for the flight was flawed: 1) I didn't protect my night vision 2) I didn't properly get the aircraft set up for night flying 3) I didn't have my firelight app set up [as it should] have been. When I headed back I flew through ZZZ Class D airspace without communicating. I usually fly around the space and I didn't realize I had entered it until I looked down at the airport.

	["While performing the flow for the taxi checklist; I forgot to turn on the probe heats. I read the taxi checklist I stated 'Anti-Ice - Set.'

Luckily; the probe heat was not critical for this flight; but nonetheless it was an unacceptable error.This was my first flight in nearly 3 months. Due to COVID-19 I have taken leave and bid for reserve which has led to the long period of not flying. Because I had not flown in a few months I was rusty on my flows. I felt that my recollection was strong enough; but in reality I should have taken some time to review SOPs.Everyone knows that flying skills and company policies/procedures are highly diminishable. In order to prepare for a flight following a period of inactivity I should have dedicated more time to review my duties. I placed too much confidence in assuming that it would all come back to me as 'second nature.'

	["While on a routine FAR part 91 training flight; my student and I were conducting practice landings and remained in the traffic pattern as announced. We had discussed prior to takeoff the importance in non-tower controlled airspace and the importance of vigilance and that we'd make additional radio calls to announce both our position and intentions. In addition; given the student's prior training and holder of a private pilot license; student added the importance of situational awareness of other traffic. We also discussed the importance to observe both the 12 O'clock and final approach area during the base leg due to the close alignment of the parallel runways at our airport.As we turned from downwind to base; I reiterated to observe the area ahead as well as the final approach area for traffic. Just prior to turning base to final I observed a plane that appeared to be at our 12 O'clock flight for the parallel runway somewhat higher than our altitude. I suddenly realized that the oncoming plane had overshot his turn and instead began a turn to final and aligned with our runway slightly above and ahead of use. I asked the student to execute a go-around so as not to [get] caught in the wake of the encroaching aircraft as at this time it was now ahead and descending for landing our intended runway. We executed the go-around; and re-entered the traffic pattern for a landing. While in the downwind I called the local FBO and asked that they get the tail number for the aircraft that had just landed and asked that the pilot remain at the FBO until my arrival. Upon landing I proceeded to the FBO where I met the pilot as he deplaned. I inquired whether he was aware of his action and he indicated he decided to use the longer of the two runways as he was high and fast; and that he never saw our aircraft. I then inquired at the frequency he was on and he indicated he had requested the UNICOM frequency from ATC and was given XYY.ZA. I indicated to him that the Tower closes at XA00 and the CTAF was the same as the Tower frequency XYB.C...he apologized; but I indicated that in light of the fact he never saw our aircraft that his actions had caused an unsafe near miss and that he should be aware that his actions were not only careless but placed safety and risk to others due to his carelessness. The take away from this event is that because of recent changes in ATC and Tower closures due to the recent cut-backs and pandemic has created unusual risk to safety due partly because of failure by novice pilot's complacency and lack of experience and non-standard practices. I suggest as a benefit to others to be vigilant in their situational awareness and review basic operating procedures.", {"entities": [[127, 134, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [175, 182, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [205, 210, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [293, 298, "AIRPLANE"], [423, 428, "CREW"], [578, 592, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [609, 617, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [661, 668, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [702, 710, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [714, 718, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [774, 788, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [829, 833, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [924, 930, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1087, 1093, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1273, 1283, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1288, 1295, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1309, 1315, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1371, 1378, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1407, 1415, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1435, 1438, "ABBREVIATION"], [1510, 1516, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1536, 1541, "CREW"], [1556, 1559, "ABBREVIATION"], [1583, 1590, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1610, 1613, "ABBREVIATION"], [1630, 1635, "CREW"], [1755, 1762, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1905, 1911, "ABBREVIATION"], [1927, 1930, "CREW"], [1981, 1986, "CREW"], [2035, 2040, "CREW"], [2387, 2390, "CREW"], [2395, 2400, "CREW"], [2526, 2531, "CREW"]]}],
	["This concerns an airframe overspeed of approximately 5 KIAS for approximately 10 seconds that occurred at FL300 and .78 mach. We had experienced two issues on takeoff; the first of which required a low-speed RTO and the second involved no FLEX annunciation on the FMA. The FO and I were discussing these events on the climbout (above 10;000) and I was mentally focused on what had happened. Upon reaching our assigned cruise altitude of FL300 I checked that the aircraft had leveled out and I picked up my iPad to start reviewing reporting requirements; ARMS codes; etc. What I did not do was properly review the FMA indications. A few moments later we got a CRC; Master Warning; and aircraft overspeed annunciation. We were approximately 5 KIAS too fast. I immediately retarded the thrust levers (to an intermediate position; not idle) and deployed the speed brakes. As we slowed down I reset the thrust levers to Climb; retracted the speed brakes; and stabilized the aircraft at the desired speed. The FO and I discussed the situation and looked over the instruments. We both agreed that the engines had stayed at climb thrust after level-off and had not retarded to a lower cruise thrust setting; leading to our acceleration and overspeed. He observed that the autothrust was not engaged. We engaged the autothrust; confirmed proper cruise indications on the FMA; and resumed normal flight. We notified maintenance of the overspeed and made an AML entry.It is likely that the autothrust never engaged during takeoff. We did not get a FLEX indication on the FMA during takeoff roll. We were prepared for this since the previous crew had reported the same thing. I advanced the thrust levers to TOGA; the FO called TOGA set; and we continued for a normal takeoff. At some point during the early climb I did notice that there was no TOGA indication on the FMA. Discussing this later with the FO; he stated that he had confirmed TOGA (and proper engine thrust) on the ECAM displacement; but not on the FMA. My subsequent failure to confirm the cruise indications on the FMA lead to me not seeing that the aircraft was accelerating into an undesired state. I also think that lack of proficiency was a contributing factor. This was my third flight (second as PF) after seven weeks off. This is the longest I have ever not flown without a simulator refresher before returning to the line.Ensure that I confirm desired aircraft state on the FMA at every phase of flight.", {"entities": [[17, 25, "AIRPLANE"], [106, 111, "ALTITUDE"], [159, 166, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [273, 275, "ABBREVIATION"], [418, 424, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [437, 442, "ALTITUDE"], [915, 920, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1004, 1006, "ABBREVIATION"], [1116, 1121, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1177, 1183, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1264, 1274, "AIRPLANE"], [1307, 1317, "AIRPLANE"], [1336, 1342, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1406, 1417, "CREW"], [1479, 1489, "AIRPLANE"], [1511, 1518, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1571, 1578, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1696, 1700, "ABBREVIATION"], [1706, 1708, "ABBREVIATION"], [1716, 1720, "ABBREVIATION"], [1756, 1763, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1796, 1801, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1833, 1837, "ABBREVIATION"], [1892, 1894, "ABBREVIATION"], [1928, 1932, "ABBREVIATION"], [1945, 1951, "AIRPLANE"], [1967, 1971, "AIRPLANE"], [2043, 2049, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2319, 2324, "FLIGHT_PHASE"]]}],
	["I feel that because of the aviation industry dramatic operational reduction in flights there should be a way to raise awareness about the risk of not having our normal operational practice for pilots; ATC; dispatchers; and everybody that is involved in the operation during these unusual times. I had not flown for more than 2 months; I was flying with a first officer which was his first flight out of OE and had never been to ZZZZ; and ATC gave us short vectors to conduct another approach when there was barely any traffic.While been vectored for a visual approach into Runway XXL into ZZZZ; we noticed that there were a few clouds right on the approach path (weather reported was VMC with SCT 1800). I was pilot flying. ATC asked us if we had the runway in sight; but we were already in IMC inside a cloud and could not accept the visual approach. We discontinued the approach and started getting vectors for Runway XYR for an RNAV APP. We got short vectors; things were happening pretty fast; we set up the approach; got the landing performance numbers; performed the briefing; and started configuring to flaps 2. During the briefing we noticed the final APP course had an off set to the RWY. There was also terrain north of the approach and the communication barriers with ZZZZ increased our work load. We got fixated outside; continued configuring; but realized we were not going to be stable at 1;000 feet. For the safety of the flight and company procedures; we decided to go-around. During the go-around; there was a 2 second red warning which I believe was spurious as it went away immediately and we didn't have time to read the ECAM message. Got vectors again for the XXR RNAV and landed safely without any further issues.\nPilot read files could remind pilots of lack of experience combined with recent inactivity could lead to loss of situational awareness. Recommend pilots configure earlier on approaches and sacrifice minor fuel savings while proficiency is retained by pilots who have been absent from the line. We were initially given vectors for a visual approach to Runway XXL; but were IMC too long to accept a visual approach clearance. We executed a discontinued approach with vectors; then took vectors for the RNAV XYR Approach. Due to high workload; minimal preparation time; and language barrier/standard phraseology issues with ATC we became task saturated and overly fixated on the approach navigation. We realized we were not configured; were unstable on the approach; and executed a missed approach.We then received vectors for another RNAV XYR approach; and landed safely without further incident.Contributing factors: Captain long period without flying. FO: First leg off IOE; unfamiliar with ZZZZ airport ATC: Language barrier; non-standard and confusing phraseology. ATC's apparent preference for XXL visual when scattered layer at 1;800 made RNAV XYR a better choice.", {"entities": [[663, 670, "WEATHER"], [2474, 2482, "WEATHER"], [2849, 2858, "WEATHER"], [2859, 2864, "WEATHER"], [193, 199, "CREW"], [201, 204, "CREW"], [305, 310, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [341, 347, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [355, 368, "CREW"], [438, 441, "CREW"], [483, 491, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [552, 567, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [648, 656, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [693, 696, "ABBREVIATION"], [710, 715, "CREW"], [716, 722, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [724, 727, "CREW"], [751, 757, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [835, 850, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [872, 880, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [931, 935, "ABBREVIATION"], [936, 939, "ABBREVIATION"], [1012, 1020, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1160, 1163, "ABBREVIATION"], [1193, 1196, "ABBREVIATION"], [1234, 1242, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1403, 1413, "ALTITUDE"], [1482, 1491, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1641, 1645, "AIRPLANE"], [1685, 1689, "ABBREVIATION"], [1694, 1700, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1766, 1772, "CREW"], [1882, 1888, "CREW"], [1910, 1920, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1987, 1993, "CREW"], [2068, 2083, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2133, 2148, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2187, 2195, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2236, 2240, "ABBREVIATION"], [2245, 2253, "CREW"], [2357, 2360, "CREW"], [2412, 2420, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2490, 2498, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2515, 2530, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2568, 2572, "ABBREVIATION"], [2577, 2585, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2591, 2597, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2652, 2659, "CREW"], [2680, 2686, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2688, 2690, "ABBREVIATION"], [2740, 2743, "CREW"], [2803, 2806, "CREW"], [2879, 2883, "ABBREVIATION"]]}],
