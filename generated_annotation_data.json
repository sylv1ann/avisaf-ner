[["To be clear I did not have a lot going on and my complexity was not high. That is why this was a non-event. However; ORD was super busy on two runways for a little bit and I am sure the Tower was very busy landing 28C departing 28R and 22L. Ground could have also been busy so that is why I put the information in there on complexity and amount of volume. Here is what happened; we were on outboards at ORD. There were a lot of aircraft going over the airport to balance the runways. I had a strip print and an aircraft depart and tag up. It was Aircraft Z. I was waiting for this aircraft to call on. I was waiting and waiting and making a plan. Then the aircraft started climbing out of 5;000 feet; so I reached out and tried to turn the aircraft. He didn't turn or answer. I didn't know what happened or was happening. Then I did it again. I was just about to call back to the Tower and the position next to me was giving a briefing and they turned their aircraft to EARND.Aircraft X. Now they departed off of two different runways but I said to the guy next to me; 'Hey; see if you have Aircraft Z by chance.' He did. So somehow Aircraft Z going westbound departing off of Runway 28R was on the same frequency as Aircraft X departing off of Runway 22L. When the instruction for Aircraft X was given; Aircraft Z and Aircraft X took it. The Controller said he didn't hear any indication that there was a step on each other or anything. During this time Aircraft Y also had departed and went to the incorrect frequency and that Controller had to send him to the correct frequency. So there were 3 similar sounding aircraft on 1 frequency when only two were supposed to be there and they were all climbing when only two were supposed to be. We have tried to explain how bad incorrect frequency transfers could be and have kept records for months but it seems there is no sense of urgency at how bad this could be. The two aircraft came within approximately 4 miles from each other with one climbing blindly. That was very lucky.My recommendations would be to track these incidents when similar sounding aircraft are on the same frequency so that it can be brought to the airline dispatchers' attention and show the replay on what could happen and why they should be aware of the issue. However; when I have brought these things recently to our supervisors in the room; they have been advised that they should not keep track of things like this by [the] upper management Operations managers and higher. They tell us we should report it when they could report it just like I can. This was luck this time that nothing happened. So I guess we will just open that Swiss cheese holes with negligence and laziness and I will be in the seat one day when two planes come together and I may not be lucky like this time to be able to listen to the person next to me give the briefing. Or we can go back to due diligence; attentiveness; and caring and report things like this and care about the operation. Put effort on everyone's end to know when similar call signs are on frequencies or multiple frequencies. Demand that Dispatch works hard to not use call signs like this. Or not; who cares any more right.", {"entities": [[186, 191, "CREW"], [880, 885, "CREW"], [117, 120, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [403, 406, "NAV_WAYPOINT"], [143, 150, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [475, 482, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1027, 1034, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [428, 436, "AIRPLANE"], [511, 519, "AIRPLANE"], [581, 589, "AIRPLANE"], [656, 664, "AIRPLANE"], [740, 748, "AIRPLANE"], [958, 966, "AIRPLANE"], [1615, 1623, "AIRPLANE"], [1922, 1930, "AIRPLANE"], [2103, 2111, "AIRPLANE"]]}],
["While descending into PIB out of 14;000 ft. MSL; our aircraft was repeatedly illuminated by a green laser pointer approximately 100 times over about 5 minutes. The first illumination was from a distance of around 20-30 miles. The aircraft had a failed flight director and autopilot at the time and extra attention was required by both pilots for flight path management. Both pilots were directly hit by the laser on several occasions causing minor vision spotting. We notified approach of the approximate source location as we went over it. The laser continued hitting the aircraft as we flew by illuminating the entire flight deck. We were able to land at PIB without incident. I still have spots in my eyes approximately 1.5 hours after exposure. This was by far the worst encounter I have had with a laser while flying an aircraft.It seems to me that pointing a laser at an aircraft should be made illegal.

["I was boarding the aircraft when a my destination airport changed a NOTAM at my destination airport closing the runway until a further time that day; at the time I was in the aircraft boarding my passengers as I had received an IFR clearance to my destination 10 minutes before. While I was departing the area VFR on an IFR clearance I encountered moderate turbulence below 9000 ft. I reported the weather conditions to both ARTCC and [Operations Control]. At 9000 ft. I entered Icing conditions and requested a higher altitude to get out of the ice. I was assigned 11000 ft. and once established in cruise approximately 50NM from billings I was advised by ARTCC that ZZZ my destination airport had just reported both runway closures and to advise of intentions. I contacted [Operations Control] of the situation and suggested a possible diversion to ZZZ1 instead so as to shuttle the passengers to ZZZ and return back REPO. They liked the plan and said they would contact ZZZ1 to gain conditions and see if they could organize passenger transport. I advised my passengers of the situation. I then was contacted by [Operations Control] that the situation was also bad in ZZZ1 and they too intended to close the runway. I then advised ATC a return to ZZZ2. Shortly after this radio communication I encountered Freezing Rain I advised ATC of the weather conditions and [Operations Control] I also requested a decent to get out of icing conditions. Shortly after this I noticed the annunciation panel was black during windshield operation and noticed the ice was not coming off the windshield. I complied with the QRH and [Requested Priority Handling] with ARTCC due to windshield anti-ice failure. I notified [Operations Control] and got into contact with the ZZZ2 station Manager and advised him of the weather conditions in the area at the diversion airport and of the priority situation. After descending several thousand feet the ice did not clear. I requested ATC give me a lower altitude to try and reach above freezing altitude. At approximately 6000 ft. the windshield ice broke off and I continued with a Visual Approach to Runway XX. After I landed and taxied in I spoke with the passengers: [airport rescue and firefighting]; [Operations Control]; Dispatch; [Maintenance Control]; Station Manager and Station Supervisor about the situation. I made a maintenance log book entry and complied with company policy and procedure to secure the aircraft at the hanger.Windshield De-ice/Anti-Ice Circuit Breaker tripped in icing conditions.

["I had a ferry flight that went out of service when a maintenance discrepancy was submitted.

I didn't notice that they had taken off yet; but when the maintenance release form came through; I realized they were already in the air.I was not aware that the origin Maintenance had told the CA (Captain) he was good to go; and I was not watching as closely as I could have been to make sure he knew he was still out of service. I assumed he would know to wait for the in service message; but with a ferry flight; many pilots often get confused on the policies/procedures.There should be more clear guidance to pilots about non-routine flights; like test flights and ferry flights; that they need to be showing in service before departing; no matter what Line Maintenance or Maintenance Control tells them.

["Aircraft X was approximately 5 Miles NW of the field when Approach Control approval-requested a right downwind entry for Runway 25; capped 2;000 and above for other VFR arrival aircraft for Runway 15L. I approved the request; as soon as traffic permitted I allowed Aircraft X his VFR descent at pilot discretion when he was approximately 2 Miles NNE of the field. Aircraft Y was 5 Miles south of the field; eastbound; on the visual approach for Runway 25. I immediately recognized the conflict. I instructed Aircraft X to turn Base; at this time he was approximately 2.5 Miles NE of the field. I informed Aircraft Y of the glider traffic and instructed him to execute a 5 Mile left base; at this time Aircraft Y was approximately 5 SE of the field. Aircraft Y asked if he needed to extend; I said affirmative; enter a 5 Mile left base. Aircraft Y immediately turned inbound for a 3 Mile left base. Aircraft X was established on a 2 Mile final and at 80 kts. I instructed Aircraft X to go around; he responded unable due to his engine being shut down. I then told Aircraft Y to go around; climb and maintain 3;000; fly heading 255. Aircraft Y read back his instructions and began to climb. I then coordinated with Approach Control; Aircraft Y was on the Standard Missed and coming back to him for re-sequence; Approach Control requested a 200 heading. I issued the 200 heading to Aircraft Y and told him to contact departure. I thought Aircraft Y had started turning and I switched him; but he was not turning. I realized he was heading into a much higher MVA. I told Aircraft Y he needed to start his turn to 200; that he was entering an MVA of 5700 feet but he had already switched frequencies. Adequate initial spacing and sequence provided by approach controller. Compliance from the Aircraft Y pilot to enter a 5 Mile left base. Compliance from Aircraft Y pilot to take assigned headings. Ensuring the pilot is physically turning to assigned heading to avoid conflict prior to frequency change.\nWe took LC (Local Control) for training; I was the trainer. It was in the middle of our training session that approach approved a right down wind arrival for RWY 25. Glider Aircraft X was told to turn a 3mile right base for RWY 25. At that time Aircraft Y was switched to us about 6 miles south of the airport on a visual approach. The trainee told Aircraft Y about glider traffic and instructed Aircraft Y to turn 5 mile left base. The trainee expected Aircraft Y to enter a 5 mile final; however; Aircraft Y turned a 5 mile left base for a 2 mile final and at that time Aircraft X was on a 2 mile going 70 kts. We realized it was not going to work with Aircraft Y going 170 kts so we tried to send Aircraft X around. Aircraft x told us they couldn't go around because their engine was off; so we made the decision to send Aircraft Y around. Initially; Aircraft Y was told to fly northerly hoping to build some space; then they were told to expect to go around. They were given a climb to 030 and a 255 heading; but they never acknowledged and continued northerly. The trainee coordinated the go around with the approach controller; which told us to give Aircraft Y a 200 heading. The trainee gave Aircraft Y that heading and switched them to approach. The aircraft continued northerly into a 5700 feet MVA for another few miles before they started their turn. After reviewing and listening to the tapes; we concluded that there was a misunderstanding between us and Aircraft Y. We gave certain instructions; but didn't get the results we expected. We should have used more control instructions such as; extend your downwind I'll call your base. We also switched Aircraft Y a bit too early; especially since he was heading in a north direction into a 5700 feet MVA.

["The First Officer noticed smoke coming from the flight counter on his yoke. We [advised ATC] and returned.\nJust prior to takeoff; both the Captain and I noticed a smell that we associated with the air conditioning system. The smell was faint prior to takeoff. After takeoff and selecting the flaps up; the smell became increasingly strong and changed to a burning plastic smell. I placed my hand on the upper half of the control wheel to initiate a turn towards a heading of 280. The flight counter (upper left) felt very hot to the touch; enough so that I couldn't touch that portion of the control wheel. I turned on my reading light and engaged the autopilot and saw smoke emanating from the flight counter. I informed the Captain and we immediately dawned masks and established Crew comm. We informed Departure of our [situation] and intention to return. Control was transferred to the Captain and I began running the smoke and fumes checklist.

["It all started at Gate XX; when we noticed a 'Service door unlocked' indication on the door's page. We recycled closing the service door a couple times without success after which we made the entry in the logbook and called maintenance. Two maintenance personnel arrived within 5 minutes and started working on it; they ended up deferring the service door and associated ground valve. Maintenance struggled with their computer system and it wasn't until XB19Z that they returned with the logbook after leaving around XA40Z without leaving explanations. Dropped the brake at XB23Z; We requested XXR to expedite the departure with an off of XB41Z. In the climb; around 8;500 feet; a caution message 'Cabin Alt' came to our attention. We [advised ATC of] our intentions to return to the field; we requested vectors with time to run the QRH. The aircraft was not pressurizing and the manual control procedure ineffective; we completed the unpressurized procedure to make sure it would be unpressurized upon landing. All appropriate communications with ATC; dispatch; operations; the cabin; and a brief PA were made. We landed at 79;000 pounds with a rate of 300 ft/min. Arrived at Gate XY and entered the discrepancies in the maintenance logbook. As we walked off the aircraft for an aircraft swap; maintenance confirmed that the ground valve had not been correctly closed when following MEL directives.Identification: In flight by EICAS messageCause: The ground valve was not properly closed by maintenanceSuggestions: Stress with maintenance personnel the implications of their work.\nThe flight began at Gate XX with a FWD Service Door amber message that would not go away after the door was cycled closed several times. Maintenance was contacted via radio at XA07Z. They sent a crew out and arrived 5 minutes later. Once the maintenance team verified the problem; they decided to MEL the Service Door indication system. This MEL necessitated the MEL of the ground valve. Maintenance completed their work and returned the aircraft logbook to the Captain at XB19Z. We finished our checklists and were 'out' at XB23Z. We requested takeoff from XXR in order to minimize further delays for our passengers and were granted the request with a subsequent 'off' time of XB41Z. During the initial climb while communicating with ZZZ Departure; we received a CABIN ALT amber caution message on the EICAS. We decided to level the plane off and the Captain [advised ATC] and requested 9;000 feet and vectors in order to run the QRH. The Captain gave me the radios and controls while he ran the QRH. The aircraft was not pressurizing at all and the manual pressurization checklist did not solve the problem. The captain then ran the QRH directed unpressurized procedure to ensure the aircraft would remain unpressurized upon landing. The Captain contacted the FAs; Dispatch; Operations; and I updated ATC with pertinent information about our emergency. We set up the aircraft for return to ZZZ and landing on XXR and briefed the approach. We discussed that the Captain would land the aircraft due to the fact it would be an overweight landing. We exchanged the controls prior to intercepting the final approach course. The Captain landed the aircraft and taxied the aircraft to the gate without further issue. The landing was made at 79;000 lbs and at a decent rate of 300 ft/min. After arrival at Gate XY; the appropriate entries were made in the logbook; walk-around completed; and the Captain notified maintenance. Upon leaving the aircraft; maintenance informed us that the ground valve was not fully closed as it should have been when completing the MEL before pushback.The failure to fully close the ground valve caused the aircraft to not pressurize during flight.", {"entities": [[1617, 1620, "ABBREVIATION"], [205, 212, "AVIATION_TERM"], [488, 495, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1234, 1241, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2029, 2036, "AVIATION_TERM"], [3432, 3439, "AVIATION_TERM"], [653, 658, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2286, 2291, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3266, 3270, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [418, 433, "AIRPLANE"], [371, 383, "AIRPLANE"], [1326, 1338, "AIRPLANE"], [1452, 1464, "AIRPLANE"], [1956, 1968, "AIRPLANE"], [3562, 3574, "AIRPLANE"], [3690, 3702, "AIRPLANE"], [224, 235, "CREW"], [241, 252, "CREW"], [1222, 1233, "CREW"], [1295, 1306, "CREW"], [565, 570, "AIRPLANE"], [1079, 1084, "AIRPLANE"], [833, 836, "ABBREVIATION"], [2513, 2516, "ABBREVIATION"], [2579, 2582, "ABBREVIATION"], [2717, 2720, "ABBREVIATION"], [54, 58, "AIRPLANE"], [87, 91, "AIRPLANE"], [132, 136, "AIRPLANE"], [351, 355, "AIRPLANE"], [1681, 1685, "AIRPLANE"], [1384, 1387, "ABBREVIATION"], [1879, 1882, "ABBREVIATION"], [1924, 1927, "ABBREVIATION"], [1945, 1948, "ABBREVIATION"], [3639, 3642, "ABBREVIATION"], [667, 677, "ALTITUDE"], [842, 850, "AIRPLANE"], [1264, 1272, "AIRPLANE"], [1280, 1288, "AIRPLANE"], [2020, 2028, "AIRPLANE"], [2588, 2596, "AIRPLANE"], [2768, 2776, "AIRPLANE"], [2951, 2959, "AIRPLANE"], [3068, 3076, "AIRPLANE"], [3226, 3234, "AIRPLANE"], [3250, 3258, "AIRPLANE"], [3519, 3527, "AIRPLANE"], [3714, 3722, "AIRPLANE"], [2470, 2480, "ALTITUDE"], [3650, 3658, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1115, 1121, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3215, 3221, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3441, 3452, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1098, 1100, "ABBREVIATION"], [614, 623, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [1428, 1433, "ABBREVIATION"], [2385, 2390, "ABBREVIATION"], [2044, 2051, "CREW"], [2434, 2441, "CREW"], [2522, 2529, "CREW"], [2822, 2829, "CREW"], [3045, 3052, "CREW"], [3207, 3214, "CREW"], [3472, 3479, "CREW"], [744, 747, "CREW"], [1048, 1051, "CREW"], [2451, 2454, "CREW"], [2885, 2888, "CREW"], [804, 811, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2485, 2492, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1003, 1010, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2809, 2816, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [2982, 2989, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3119, 3126, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [3298, 3305, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [18, 22, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1177, 1181, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1602, 1606, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [3382, 3386, "AIRPORT_TERM"]]}],

["When the crew arrived at [the aircraft]; Maintenance Control had deferred the ground idle portion of the EEC's (Electronic Engine Control). Myself as the Captain looked over the DDG (Dispatch Deviation Guide); talked with the two mechanics on board and found that everything was written off properly. The Mechanic and I discussed the ramifications a little bit on the referral. The plane blocked out on time with a normal engine start and normal taxi to [the] runway. However upon takeoff clearance and bringing the thrust levers up to approximately 70% we noticed the right engine was accelerating quicker than the left engine. It wasn't exceeding any limitations but still as the Captain and because we had the deferral concerning the situation ; I felt it would be better/ conservative to just bring the thrust levers back and taxi off the runway and discuss what was actually going on with the mechanics in a safe environment on the taxiway and that is what I did. I asked the First Officer to cancel takeoff clearance and that we would like to clear the runway and discuss a possible maintenance issue. So we cleared the runway; I spoke to the mechanics about the situation and it is quite common on most of the 767 200s for the right engine to accelerate quicker than the left engine. I don't know why this is but I've noticed it on many different airplanes. So we cleared the runway.I spoke to the mechanics about the situation. I remembered talking to Maintenance Control the day before and he informed me there are no time limits for the engines to accelerate together. At this moment on the taxiway I confirm that with the two mechanics that only the two engines had to match and then accelerate uniformly after takeoff thrust button was pushed and takeoff power is set. After clearing the runway there were no checklists to be run since there are no EICAS messages or abnormal events. I just wanted to understand that everything was fairly normal. The break chart was not needed to be consulted since we never really release the brakes for takeoff. Takeoff power was never set. By definition in the FOM a rejected takeoff was never really performed since take off power was never set however I am going to treat this like a rejected takeoff just in case. The two mechanics and the First Officer and myself discussed that we would perform the takeoff again.... let the engines both stabilize at approximately 70% and then push the takeoff thrust button and if the engines accelerated absolutely perfectly symmetrically to takeoff thrust then we would continue the takeoff. This is exactly what happened on the second takeoff and this is normally what happens on most of the 767 200s. The engines do not accelerate to 70% symmetrically all the time but they do accelerate from 70%to takeoff thrust symmetrically. Maintenance Control and the mechanics confirmed there is no time limit to where these engines have to accelerate to the 70% setting. The takeoff was normal.\n[Report narrative contained no additional information.]", {"entities": [[2040, 2046, "AIRPLANE"], [230, 239, "CREW"], [898, 907, "CREW"], [1149, 1158, "CREW"], [1405, 1414, "CREW"], [1637, 1646, "CREW"], [2274, 2283, "CREW"], [2850, 2859, "CREW"], [460, 466, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [843, 849, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1059, 1065, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1126, 1132, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1383, 1389, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1800, 1806, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [516, 529, "AIRPLANE"], [807, 820, "AIRPLANE"], [123, 137, "AIRPLANE"], [422, 428, "AIRPLANE"], [575, 581, "AIRPLANE"], [621, 627, "AIRPLANE"], [1240, 1246, "AIRPLANE"], [1283, 1289, "AIRPLANE"], [1737, 1743, "AIRPLANE"], [2456, 2462, "AIRPLANE"], [9, 13, "CREW"], [981, 994, "CREW"], [2292, 2305, "CREW"], [243, 248, "AIRPLANE"], [481, 498, "AVIATION_TERM"], [1005, 1022, "AVIATION_TERM"], [382, 387, "AIRPLANE"], [105, 108, "ABBREVIATION"], [30, 38, "AIRPLANE"], [41, 60, "CREW"], [1460, 1479, "CREW"], [2822, 2841, "CREW"], [318, 319, "CREW"], [2116, 2132, "AVIATION_TERM"], [2235, 2251, "AVIATION_TERM"], [937, 944, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [1601, 1608, "AIRPORT_TERM"], [154, 161, "CREW"], [682, 689, "CREW"], [446, 450, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [830, 834, "FLIGHT_PHASE"], [305, 313, "CREW"], [178, 181, "ABBREVIATION"]]}]
